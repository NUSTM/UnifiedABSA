this unit is ` ` pretty ` ` and stylish , so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason .####['laptop design features']
for now i ' m okay with upping the experience & device to 3 out of 5 stars .####['laptop general']
seems unlikely but whatever , i ' ll go with it .####['laptop general']
this version has been my least favorite version i ' ve had for the following reasons listed bellow the pros .####['laptop general']
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####['hardware general']
should not of bought this chromebook .####['laptop general']
after about 5 / 10 minutes of use the screen goes crazy and you have to force to power down and wait to restart .####['display operation performance']
i can not stand the trackpad or the keyboard keys .####['keyboard general']
one day it just would not power up .####['battery operation performance']
what really did it was when i tried contacting acer support i was simply told ` ` try a restart ` ` and then ` ` call google , we can ' t help you ` ` .####['support general']
returning it after one day####['laptop general']
after some use , the battery charge had logically gone down some ( down to about 80 % ) , and so i went back to my office to plug it in .####['battery operation performance']
i had it on my desk and was watching youtube videos and it went black .####['laptop operation performance']
the screen is very dim however .####['display operation performance']
the brand new vivobook is dead in the water !####['laptop quality']
screen is amazing####['display general']
overall this is a good system for the price and i do recommend the ssd for the price .####['hard disc price', 'os price']
but my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises , both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk .####['fans&cooling operation performance']
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####['company general', 'laptop general']
if you can save for 750 - 800 i would recommend going up a bit in the asus line .####['company general']
bought this on may , barely used it and now 4 months later it ' s randomly shutting down every few minutes .####['laptop general']
pros : lightweight and looks nice .####['laptop portability', 'laptop general']
this computer has wasted so much of my time already .####['laptop general']
it opens programs immediately .####['os operation performance']
i do not think i will need to upgrade the ram .####['memory general']
the plastic that borders the screen kind of comes out ever so slightly .####['display design features']
it ' s pretty fast for a laptop especially a laptop in this price point .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop price']
the picture clarity is amazing and the backlit keyboard is awesome .####['display quality', 'keyboard design features']
overall , this budget laptop ticks all the boxes and there is nothing on the market that is new with so many features crammed in at this price .####['laptop general']
the bluetooth connects easily to everything .####['multimedia devices connectivity']
- the battery life is excellent ( i get 6 - 8 hours of normal university student usage out of it ) and even when i ' m using it , it charges as fast as my phone .####['battery operation performance']
the chromebook has instant connection and a hugely impressive 8 - hour battery life when left on .####['battery operation performance', 'laptop connectivity']
if you are in the google echo system , then this is great .####['software general']
he loves it .####['laptop general']
that being said , my son loves it .####['laptop general']
i loved mine , so i got her the same one .####['laptop general']
a good product !####['laptop general']
overall , this was a good buy and i still love my purchase nonetheless .####['laptop general']
i ' m using it mainly to store movies , and the 1 tb drive is nice .####['hard disc general']
nice keyboard .####['keyboard general']
i have always loved loved the kindles .####['laptop general']
my only complaint is that the mouse keypad is a little big .####['mouse design features']
only thing i really didn ' t like about this was how quickly the battery drained .####['battery operation performance']
i have n ' t used it much for gaming but i imagine it works fine .####['laptop operation performance']
if you ' re big on aesthetics then you ' ll love the look .####['laptop design features']
i will never use another microsoft program as long as i live .####['software general']
just a home pc laptop that works very well .####['laptop operation performance']
this is just perfect .####['laptop general']
very happy with this laptop although not a fan of windows 10 .####['laptop general', 'os general']
using it for doing programming , app development , and electronics projects .####['laptop general']
which is really sad because in the time i could actually use the chromebook i absolutely loved it .####['laptop general']
i tried it , and it is very limited for the current price of $ 550 .####['laptop operation performance']
many apps aren ' t ` ` compatible ` ` and even the ones that work , they look awful .####['software operation performance']
another expensive & poorly executed samsung product .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop price']
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####['laptop price']
for home users , these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two - screening , to watching videos and calling family .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop price']
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####['cpu operation performance', 'cpu price']
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####['laptop quality']
i was extremely hesitant to buy a used macbook pro ( it ' s still a lot of money ) but so far am surprisingly pleased with it .####['laptop general']
- new ports that were not in the 2011 model : hdmi port , extra thunderbolt video port ( now it has two instead of one )####['ports general']
honestly , i think nobody uses these ports anyway .####['ports general']
these macbook pro computers are expensive .####['laptop price']
i think for others they are just buying into the brand .####['company general']
i am extremely happy with this laptop .####['laptop general']
it doesn ' t effect any of the functionality , but it was a little disappointing to open the box to see a dent on something i ' d just spend $ 1 , 000 on .####['laptop general']
great product !####['laptop general']
the retina screen is amazing .####['display operation performance']
less of a fault of the much lauded diving board and more a factor of the very well designed new hardware .####['hardware design features']
battery life is a huge plus !####['battery operation performance']
my first mac is awesome !####['laptop general']
this laptop has all the necessary ports .####['laptop design features']
as i bought 13 inch model , it is very portable .####['laptop portability']
the only drawback is that it only comes with 32 gb of hard drive .####['hard disc design features']
either they were so slow i couldn ' t get any work done or they just flat out broke after a couple months .####['laptop operation performance']
i guess i got one of the good ones as i have had no trouble at all .####['laptop general']
* extremely weak graphics card .####['graphics operation performance']
i can ' t use my printer because it ' s not supported .####['ports usability']
now i ' m just down to some gripes that are probably here to stay : the bluetooth on this thing is really fussy , the non - functional video output ( using usb - c video out through an hdmi cable sends just a blank desktop background and no audio , even if i am playing a movie or youtube visibly on the c302 screen ) , and that it can ' t hold a vpn connection without dropping it every 20 - 30 minutes .####['hardware operation performance', 'laptop connectivity']
the funny part is that the customer service people have been great but they have no control to take care of problems .####['support general']
anyhow , within a week , the speakers started crackling annoyingly when watching videos , or playing games .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
unlike other asus laptops i ' ve tried , this unit won the display roulette .####['laptop design features']
the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####['software operation performance']
it also had charging problems and got terrible warranty support .####['warranty general', 'power supply general']
if bluetooth devices worked with this chromebook it would get 5 stars , but this is the least reliable device in regards to bluetooth i have ever owned .####['laptop general']
was initially impressed by design but after normal use without any rough handling or dropping of the chromebook , the metal corner tip covering the lcd peels off & warps / bends upwards !####['hardware quality']
games / video apps perform absolutely awfully .####['software operation performance']
after one charge , the battery would not take charge .####['battery operation performance']
it will not power on anymore after 2 mos of daily use - 4 hours per day .####['laptop operation performance']
first , the factory default driver configuration of this thing is unstable , which makes installing a correct configuration more difficult .####['software operation performance']
the mouse pad is very touchy , but i use a separate bluetooth mouse anyways .####['hardware operation performance']
the laptop its - self is great and is made of good build quality .####['laptop quality', 'laptop general']
beautiful screen .####['display general']
i have had this laptop two months now and it has crashed as many times .####['laptop operation performance']
this laptop is small and thin for a 15 .####['laptop design features']
battery life doesn ' t seem to be more than 5 hours , but i expected that going in .####['battery quality']
most of the laptop is actually very good , but is held back by a 5400 rpm hdd .####['hard disc general', 'laptop general']
the screen looks amazing , ips it seems .####['display design features']
loving the laptop .####['laptop general']
it ' s light weight , sleek , the screen resolution is great and it runs very well for everyday use .####['display general', 'laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
it charges very fast ; from near dead to full in less than an hour .####['power supply operation performance']
on it ' s own , it performance great !####['laptop operation performance']
love the form factor and the light weight as i often use my laptop while laying down .####['laptop design features']
the laptop was shipped in what looked like a new case but upon opening it , it appeared used and repackaged .####['shipping quality']
looks like the hdmi port may be defective or something - - another reviewer had a similar problem .####['ports operation performance']
( good ) as for the laptop ( when it worked , and i mean for the whole 30 minutes ) it was extremely fast .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
adequate screen .####['display general']
unfortunately i was never able to complete this task , because after booting the laptop it suddenly shut - off on me and wouldn ' t turn back on again .####['laptop operation performance']
the wall power adapter charger is not working and then later caught fire .####['power supply operation performance']
one of the keys is especially flimsy and feels like it could break at any moment .####['keyboard quality']
similarly the task tray area of the main task bar is on the small side and lends itself to fat - fingering .####['software design features']
a big part of this device is its gorgeous aesthetic .####['laptop design features']
this is a great device and the $ 450 asking price seems fair .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
quality is excellent so far , and the software / hardware combination works like they were made for each other ( which is what you want : ) )####['laptop quality', 'hardware operation performance', 'software operation performance']
it ' s sturdy , and looks and feels great .####['laptop design features']
love the backlit keyboard .####['keyboard general']
at least the volume through bluetooth was tolerable .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
this works great .####['laptop operation performance']
after two years , or almost , the worst thing about this machine is lack of printer support .####['laptop design features']
it has exceeded my expectations for performance , functionality and utility .####['laptop operation performance']
in general , it has the look and feel of a premium laptop that is at home in any situation such as sitting down with a client .####['laptop design features']
this is my third chromebook and easily the best i ' ve encountered .####['laptop general']
battery life is also solid .####['battery operation performance']
construction looks and feels great .####['laptop design features']
it ' s fast and the screen is nice .####['display general', 'laptop operation performance']
i ' ve already recommended or bought this for 4 others .####['laptop general']
the best laptop i have ever owned .####['laptop general']
i loved the tablet transition to it .####['laptop design features']
cons : no usb ports .####['ports design features']
