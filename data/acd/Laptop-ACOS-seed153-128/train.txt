this device ( and its brother the plus ) has a grave hardware flaw that causes the touchscreen to move on its own .####['hardware operation performance', 'display operation performance']
ridiculous for something so expensive , some internet research shows numerous people having this issue .####['laptop price']
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .####['display operation performance']
i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of keyboards and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .####['keyboard general']
except , you know , when it decided to become unusable .####['laptop operation performance']
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####['laptop design features', 'keyboard general']
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .####['keyboard operation performance']
bought this for someone else , can ' t believe how good it is .####['laptop general']
it ' s great in many ways ; the build is solid , the screen is good ( and the resolution is insane ) , and the keyboard is decent , though only time will tell if it ' s as diet coke - resistant as the samsung ' s keys are .####['display general', 'laptop quality', 'laptop general', 'keyboard design features', 'display design features']
the 1080p display is very sharp .####['display operation performance']

the display is amazing and the new force click trackpad is an awesome addition .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard general']

i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !####['laptop general']

i ' ve only had it for one day and the set up was easy , and all items delivered were present , will update over time !####['os usability']
it is a great laptop !####['laptop general']
very nicely packed in original box .####['shipping general']
works great !####['laptop operation performance']
i bought this chromebook on the prime day deal , but even without $ 60 off it would still have been worth the money .####['laptop price']
i thought the gizmo was neat but i was disappointed that i couldn ' t really use it the way i wanted to it that regards .####['laptop operation performance']
in preparation for becoming a chromebook user i had purchased a 256 gig memory card and moved all my laptop files to it .####['memory general']
the machine looks amazing doesn ' t it !####['laptop general']
i ' m pretty sure i ordered the biggest size , and i got the smaller one , but whatever it shipped fast and it works great .####['shipping general', 'laptop operation performance']
have not heard any complaints about the product .####['laptop general']
- for such a premium price , this is definitely the worst purchase quality wise that i have made .####['laptop quality', 'laptop price']
your new retina screen will get stains on it from the top layer seperating and or dead pixels .####['display quality']
but this asus , who offered so much & rated over 4 stars , turned to a black screen , just over a month after i received it .####['laptop operation performance']
we ' ve got android nougat on beta running pretty well now .####['os operation performance']
the c302 is clean and feels solid .####['laptop design features']
i loved this chromebook , it worked great for six months .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
now the romance is over ; it won ' t charge , and my only option is to send it in for service , a 10 - day event not including shipping there and back .####['power supply operation performance']
i can plug it in and put it back to sleep and it will charge , but if i haven ' t woken it up it won ' t begin to charge .####['laptop operation performance']
but today i noticed it ' s cracking ( ref : pics ) .####['laptop operation performance']
it is the nicest chrome computer i have ever owned .####['laptop general']
it surfs the internet fast .####['laptop connectivity']
cursor won ' t move and touchscreen won ' t work and from reading about this online i am not alone with this issue .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance']
nice screen , nice feel .####['display quality']
chromebook is 2 months old and charger stopped working .####['power supply operation performance']
i still love the laptop , i ' m just a bit disappointed by this and i hope it ' s the only issue i see .####['laptop general']
moreover i ' m quite upset because it seems amazon will not pay me back the shipping fees , which for me amount to about 100 $ as i live in france .####['shipping general']
i much suspect that google ' s half baked sustem is at fault .####['os general']
the first week i had my chromebook it locked up .####['laptop operation performance']
i loved this chromebook but i had to return it bevause it had sound issues .####['multimedia devices operation performance', 'laptop general']
the screen is great and the unit is fast .####['display general', 'laptop operation performance']
everything was good for a few days after receiving the product .####['laptop general']
very disappointing in an otherwise great product####['laptop general']
very fast product , but with this kind of technology it ' s not possible to use a program , that i work ( minitab ) .####['laptop operation performance']
it simply refuses to boot .####['laptop quality']
however , i tried to power it up today and kept receiving an error message right at startup that was a ` ` system boot violation ` ` .####['laptop operation performance']
it only comes with 8 gb or ram not 16 .####['memory design features']
the keys feel nice and responsive however the mouse pad is a little over responsive .####['hardware operation performance', 'keyboard general']
the monitor looks fantastic , but i still cant get over the fact that you are basically lied to aboit memory availability .####['display design features', 'memory general']
the computer ' s hardware is decent , but the materials are poor .####['laptop quality', 'hardware general']
cpu and gpu are good , ram is good and i like the keyboard .####['graphics general', 'cpu general', 'memory general', 'keyboard general']
do not buy this .####['laptop general']
the screen on this looks great , the bezels aren ' t noticeable .####['display design features', 'laptop design features']
i bought this laptop for software development .####['laptop general']
the notebook is very well built and it could easily pass as a high - end machine .####['laptop quality', 'laptop general']
purchased this mid november , because of the 8th gen i5 , and other good specs for the great price .####['cpu general', 'laptop price', 'laptop general']
i can ' t really testify to its battery - life as i have not used it to the point where the battery is totally dissipated .####['battery operation performance']
computer was used very little and stopped working after 6 months####['laptop operation performance']
i ' ve had it for less than two months it randomly shuts down .####['laptop operation performance']
the touchpad is quite sensitive i ' ve noticed , not a big issue to me .####['hardware operation performance']
the laptop build is cheap looking and basic , but functional to say the least while i save up money .####['laptop quality', 'laptop operation performance']
below medium build quality####['laptop quality']
this thing is slow !####['laptop operation performance']
this is a painfully slow computer .####['laptop operation performance']
they are clearly working with more than one person at a time , and not effective multi - taskers .####['support general']
this computer completely shut down after 2 months .####['laptop quality']
it felt flimsy , but decent .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features']
i ' ve been waiting for this chromebook for some time now and having only had it for about two weeks , i can say that the device and purchase were well worth it .####['laptop general']
the surface texture of the case is a satiny paper - like touch , which is both clean and easy to wipe down , but also not so smooth that you have to be concerned with it slipping out of your hand when carrying it .####['laptop usability', 'laptop design features']
- backlit keyboard rocks####['keyboard design features']
the default scaling 1536x864 looks excellent and sharp to me .####['display operation performance']
again , this is where the build quality really shines .####['laptop quality']
one , the display is gorgeous ; watching video is a treat .####['display operation performance']
the core m3 allows this system to get fast and to stay quiet .####['cpu operation performance']
boot speed : likewise , very fast -####['os operation performance']
the usb - c ports are nice and i found that a completely dead battery to fully charged time was about an hour .####['ports general', 'power supply operation performance']
* battery - i can not really speak to the battery life yet , but as a power user with lots of tabs and several apps open , it is giving me a days use 5 + hours of use so far .####['battery operation performance']
it ' s one of the best chromebook in the market if not the best .####['laptop general']
only problem i have had , which was from the moment i started using it is the audio .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
i knocked off a star for build quality control .####['laptop quality']
i really like this chromebook .####['laptop general']
this is a great device if your main goal is to check email , surf the internet listen to music or watch videos .####['laptop general']
i have to say that the keyboard is my favorite feature .####['keyboard general']
track pad is passable .####['keyboard general']
great display .####['display general']
the speakers are not great , but bluetooth connection to an external speaker is standard these days and it ' s how we watch movies .####['ports connectivity']
i ' d say the only drawback might be the speakers .####['multimedia devices general']
overall it has been a wonder experience and quality product .####['laptop quality']
i have to say , this is a very nice product .####['laptop general']
i didn ' t want to spend much on this as it is my first laptop , but i was convinced by a few reviews to upgrade to this model as it has more ram and performs better in several areas .####['laptop operation performance']
an awesome product , well built - well worth your time and money .####['laptop quality', 'laptop general']
the keyboard is nice to type on .####['keyboard operation performance']
