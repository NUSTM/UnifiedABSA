this unit is ` ` pretty ` ` and stylish , so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason .####['laptop design features']
for now i ' m okay with upping the experience & device to 3 out of 5 stars .####['laptop general']
seems unlikely but whatever , i ' ll go with it .####['laptop general']
this version has been my least favorite version i ' ve had for the following reasons listed bellow the pros .####['laptop general']
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####['hardware general']
should not of bought this chromebook .####['laptop general']
after about 5 / 10 minutes of use the screen goes crazy and you have to force to power down and wait to restart .####['display operation performance']
i can not stand the trackpad or the keyboard keys .####['keyboard general']
the keyboard is stiff and unresponsive to my typing at times .####['keyboard quality']
one day it just would not power up .####['battery operation performance']
what really did it was when i tried contacting acer support i was simply told ` ` try a restart ` ` and then ` ` call google , we can ' t help you ` ` .####['support general']
returning it after one day####['laptop general']
after some use , the battery charge had logically gone down some ( down to about 80 % ) , and so i went back to my office to plug it in .####['battery operation performance']
asus customer support was through chat and cumbersome .####['support general']
i had it on my desk and was watching youtube videos and it went black .####['laptop operation performance']
the screen is very dim however .####['display operation performance']
the brand new vivobook is dead in the water !####['laptop quality']
sounds like a good deal for a $ 620 laptop but battery doesn ' t perform as promised i am hardly getting 4 hrs .####['battery operation performance', 'laptop price']
screen is amazing####['display general']
thin bezels allow for a compact frame####['laptop design features']
overall this is a good system for the price and i do recommend the ssd for the price .####['os price', 'hard disc price']
but my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises , both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk .####['fans&cooling operation performance']
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####['company general', 'laptop general']
if you can save for 750 - 800 i would recommend going up a bit in the asus line .####['company general']
it seems like there is a problem with the processor because it constantly starts and stops while i ' m trying to surf the web .####['cpu general']
bought this on may , barely used it and now 4 months later it ' s randomly shutting down every few minutes .####['laptop general']
pros : lightweight and looks nice .####['laptop portability', 'laptop general']
this computer is loud !####['laptop design features']
i am so disgusted and disheartened by my dealings with asus support , it ' s hard to believe .####['support quality']
returned because had it less than a month and it decided to go crazy and start typing by its self ect .####['laptop operation performance']
this computer has wasted so much of my time already .####['laptop general']
it opens programs immediately .####['os operation performance']
i do not think i will need to upgrade the ram .####['memory general']
acer made a winner here !####['laptop general']
buy this computer and you ' ll be very happy with it .####['laptop price']
the ports were another thing that i was really excited to see fully included on a laptop in this price range .####['laptop price', 'ports general']
i ' ve been happy being able to plug in and run overwatch from time to time on this laptop , with higher settings .####['laptop design features']
i like that it ' s got the 8th generation i5 cpu .####['cpu general']
dedicated graphics card####['graphics general']
the plastic that borders the screen kind of comes out ever so slightly .####['display design features']
it ' s pretty fast for a laptop especially a laptop in this price point .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop price']
the picture clarity is amazing and the backlit keyboard is awesome .####['display quality', 'keyboard design features']
overall , this budget laptop ticks all the boxes and there is nothing on the market that is new with so many features crammed in at this price .####['laptop general']
also love that access to the hd / ssd and ram slots is really easy .####['memory design features']
the bluetooth connects easily to everything .####['multimedia devices connectivity']
- the battery life is excellent ( i get 6 - 8 hours of normal university student usage out of it ) and even when i ' m using it , it charges as fast as my phone .####['battery operation performance']
- the spacebar is finicky .####['keyboard design features']
the chromebook has instant connection and a hugely impressive 8 - hour battery life when left on .####['battery operation performance', 'laptop connectivity']
i just got it today and i love it !####['laptop general']
if you are in the google echo system , then this is great .####['software general']
he loves it .####['laptop general']
a great chromebook at a very reasonable price , includes the google play store .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
that being said , my son loves it .####['laptop general']
this is a functional laptop , perfect for work and casual internet browsing .####['laptop operation performance']
great computer and great value , our second chromebook and first one still doing fine just needed another for family .####['laptop general']
i wanted an inexpensive chromebook and this fit the bill .####['laptop price']
set up is take out of box and open cover .####['laptop usability']
works great .####['laptop operation performance']
i loved mine , so i got her the same one .####['laptop general']
can ' t really find a viewing angle where all of it looks right at the same time .####['display operation performance']
very easy to set up .####['laptop usability']
the chromebook was packaged well and we saw no defects ( ours was used ) .####['shipping quality']
it is a basic little laptop and i love it .####['laptop general']
linux is a fairly light os depending on the distro you use .####['os design features']
there is a lot of ' bang for your buck ' in the lenovo ideapad 320 .####['laptop general']
low rpm hdd .####['hard disc operation performance']
excellent laptop good speed on uploads and download .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
a good product !####['laptop general']
love this so much !####['laptop general']
overall , this was a good buy and i still love my purchase nonetheless .####['laptop general']
i ' m using it mainly to store movies , and the 1 tb drive is nice .####['hard disc general']
nice keyboard .####['keyboard general']
i have always loved loved the kindles .####['laptop general']
my only complaint is that the mouse keypad is a little big .####['mouse design features']
so , i have had this laptop for almost a week and have put it through the ringer .####['laptop general']
only thing i really didn ' t like about this was how quickly the battery drained .####['battery operation performance']
i have n ' t used it much for gaming but i imagine it works fine .####['laptop operation performance']
my kids have played roblox and minecraft on it along with fortnite so i think it can handle online gaming pretty good .####['laptop operation performance']
if you ' re big on aesthetics then you ' ll love the look .####['laptop design features']
i will never use another microsoft program as long as i live .####['software general']
just a home pc laptop that works very well .####['laptop operation performance']
this is just perfect .####['laptop general']
very happy with this laptop although not a fan of windows 10 .####['os general', 'laptop general']
using it for doing programming , app development , and electronics projects .####['laptop general']
it is very good for the price .####['laptop price']
but , until that time , this review stands as : do not buy if your care about the display ' s life .####['display general']
i was skeptical ordering this because of the conflicting reviews .####['laptop general']
it keep going off on sleep mode without any way to wake it up .####['laptop operation performance']
which is really sad because in the time i could actually use the chromebook i absolutely loved it .####['laptop general']
i tried it , and it is very limited for the current price of $ 550 .####['laptop operation performance']
many apps aren ' t ` ` compatible ` ` and even the ones that work , they look awful .####['software operation performance']
another expensive & poorly executed samsung product .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop price']
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop quality', 'display general']
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####['laptop price']
for home users , these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two - screening , to watching videos and calling family .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop price']
as a 5 - year chromebook veteran , i ' ve been waiting for this machine .####['laptop general']
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####['cpu operation performance', 'cpu price']
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####['laptop quality']
i was pleasantly surprised at how good it is .####['laptop general']
i was extremely hesitant to buy a used macbook pro ( it ' s still a lot of money ) but so far am surprisingly pleased with it .####['laptop general']
- new ports that were not in the 2011 model : hdmi port , extra thunderbolt video port ( now it has two instead of one )####['ports general']
i had the chance to test the new radeon graphics card and it ' s really good .####['graphics general']
honestly , i think nobody uses these ports anyway .####['ports general']
maybe that ' s a consequence of how the retina display is built , but yeah , it ' s harder to keep the screen clean .####['display general']
i do wish the screen were bigger , but i had to go with the 13 ` ` due to budget constraints , so that ' s on me .####['display general']
these macbook pro computers are expensive .####['laptop price']
i think for others they are just buying into the brand .####['company general']
i love the retina display .####['display general']
i am extremely happy with this laptop .####['laptop general']
it doesn ' t effect any of the functionality , but it was a little disappointing to open the box to see a dent on something i ' d just spend $ 1 , 000 on .####['laptop general']
great product !####['laptop general']
battery issues aside , i really love this laptop and it is easily the nicest piece of electronics i have ever owned .####['battery general', 'laptop general']
neat and sleek build , great display and very nice os####['laptop design features', 'os general', 'display general']
the new touchpad takes a little getting used to , but otherwise it ' s been perfect .####['keyboard general', 'laptop general']
the retina screen is amazing .####['display operation performance']
less of a fault of the much lauded diving board and more a factor of the very well designed new hardware .####['hardware design features']
not to mention , the touchbar is just another gimmicky addition to the ` ` future of apple ` ` ( really not as effective as one would think ) .####['keyboard general']
a great computer !####['laptop general']
battery life is a huge plus !####['battery operation performance']
price was very good and met my expectations also shipping was very quick .####['laptop price', 'shipping general']
my first mac is awesome !####['laptop general']
this laptop has all the necessary ports .####['laptop design features']
as i bought 13 inch model , it is very portable .####['laptop portability']
overall : i ' m super happy with this product .####['laptop general']
it feels responsive to me , and i went to settings to customize the speed , clicking , and scrolling .####['hardware operation performance']
the only drawback is that it only comes with 32 gb of hard drive .####['hard disc design features']
configuring the printer was a little tricky but not bad .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
either they were so slow i couldn ' t get any work done or they just flat out broke after a couple months .####['laptop operation performance']
this is where the r11 gets interesting .####['laptop usability']
i have not had any freezing or screen flashing issues .####['display operation performance']
i guess i got one of the good ones as i have had no trouble at all .####['laptop general']
did i mention , i can access all my word , excel , and powerpoint files using the google apps .####['software usability']
i have had it about 4 days and have been checking out how well it runs my favorite android apps .####['laptop operation performance', 'software operation performance']
unfortunately , this particular computer is 100 % unusable after only 2 years and 2 weeks .####['laptop usability']
it is a timeless design and a very respectable screen .####['laptop design features', 'display general']
apple has always priced their hardware high , but you could always make an argument for the style , nice hardware and the unique osx experience .####['hardware general', 'laptop design features', 'company price', 'os general']
* extremely weak graphics card .####['graphics operation performance']
i can ' t use my printer because it ' s not supported .####['ports usability']
now i ' m just down to some gripes that are probably here to stay : the bluetooth on this thing is really fussy , the non - functional video output ( using usb - c video out through an hdmi cable sends just a blank desktop background and no audio , even if i am playing a movie or youtube visibly on the c302 screen ) , and that it can ' t hold a vpn connection without dropping it every 20 - 30 minutes .####['laptop connectivity', 'hardware operation performance']
sometimes they felt a bit half - baked , but i loved the idea , and the keyboard made a world of difference in what you could do with that tablet .####['keyboard general', 'laptop general']
- good screen .####['display general']
the funny part is that the customer service people have been great but they have no control to take care of problems .####['support general']
all metal body , very slim form factor , and has a pretty decent touchscreen .####['laptop design features', 'display general']
anyhow , within a week , the speakers started crackling annoyingly when watching videos , or playing games .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
unlike other asus laptops i ' ve tried , this unit won the display roulette .####['laptop design features']
the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####['software operation performance']
it also had charging problems and got terrible warranty support .####['power supply general', 'warranty general']
i got the same failure to charge issue that others have reported .####['power supply general']
if bluetooth devices worked with this chromebook it would get 5 stars , but this is the least reliable device in regards to bluetooth i have ever owned .####['laptop general']
i feel like i bought a decent machine but it ' s unable to handle the ram workload .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
i don ' t think that i was adequately prepared for how dark the screen is at its highest brightness in comparison to other devices .####['display design features']
was initially impressed by design but after normal use without any rough handling or dropping of the chromebook , the metal corner tip covering the lcd peels off & warps / bends upwards !####['hardware quality']
to say i ' m disappointed in this chromebook would be an understatement .####['laptop general']
this computer is really hard to use .####['laptop usability']
it ' s their policy to only repair not replace .####['support quality']
+ comfortable keyboard####['keyboard design features']
decent enough build , but the mouse pad is terrible .####['keyboard general', 'laptop design features']
games / video apps perform absolutely awfully .####['software operation performance']
after one charge , the battery would not take charge .####['battery operation performance']
it will not power on anymore after 2 mos of daily use - 4 hours per day .####['laptop operation performance']
i really liked it when i first got it , it performs very well and the software is very easy to use .####['laptop operation performance', 'software usability']
first , the factory default driver configuration of this thing is unstable , which makes installing a correct configuration more difficult .####['software operation performance']
the mouse pad is very touchy , but i use a separate bluetooth mouse anyways .####['hardware operation performance']
i didn ' t even call for tech help because a brand new laptop should not be giving me such a headache .####['laptop general']
the laptop its - self is great and is made of good build quality .####['laptop quality', 'laptop general']
beautiful screen .####['display general']
monitor screen is ok , sometimes the contrast is poor but looks better in games .####['display operation performance']
if i had it to do over again , i would not buy this pc .####['laptop general']
i would * not * recommend this laptop .####['laptop general']
this is the absolute worst laptop i have ever owned .####['laptop general']
now , i have been stressed with fixing this laptop since every day has been something new that i need to fix with it .####['laptop operation performance']
the overall material the laptop is made of feels incredibly cheap .####['laptop design features']
don ' t waste your money on this computer , it will disapoint you in every way possible .####['laptop general']
the laptop was dead on arrival .####['laptop general']
it is not a very stable build at all .####['laptop design features']
i have had this laptop two months now and it has crashed as many times .####['laptop operation performance']
this is the worst laptop i have ever bought in my entire life .####['laptop general']
this laptop is small and thin for a 15 .####['laptop design features']
- keyboard is not that good , i fell that there is uneven uniformity in the button press and travel , and definitely some flex .####['keyboard usability']
battery life doesn ' t seem to be more than 5 hours , but i expected that going in .####['battery quality']
battery charger is super tiny and lightweight , which is an additional advantage vs the 1 lb brick that you have to lug around with the ux501vw .####['power supply design features']
most of the laptop is actually very good , but is held back by a 5400 rpm hdd .####['hard disc general', 'laptop general']
other than that its components are actually very good .####['laptop general']
the screen looks amazing , ips it seems .####['display design features']
loving the laptop .####['laptop general']
it ' s light weight , sleek , the screen resolution is great and it runs very well for everyday use .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features', 'display general']
it charges very fast ; from near dead to full in less than an hour .####['power supply operation performance']
i got this laptop for school and it is simply amazing .####['laptop general']
this has been a very light convenient laptop for me .####['laptop design features', 'laptop usability']
i have no issues with using the internal hard drive , it works fast enough for me when loading up my software and music .####['hard disc operation performance']
this little vivo had the speed / storage that we need , the materials feel substantial instead of cheap .####['laptop quality', 'laptop general']
on it ' s own , it performance great !####['laptop operation performance']
love the form factor and the light weight as i often use my laptop while laying down .####['laptop design features']
opening it was a little hard but once opened , it ' s easy to add the ram or ssd .####['laptop design features']
less than that , for me , the screen looks dull .####['display quality']
the laptop was shipped in what looked like a new case but upon opening it , it appeared used and repackaged .####['shipping quality']
freezes with red lines across it , froze five times the first afternoon .####['laptop operation performance']
had problems with my acer chromebook from the very start .####['laptop operation performance']
every few weeks the system locks up and freezes .####['os operation performance']
looks like the hdmi port may be defective or something - - another reviewer had a similar problem .####['ports operation performance']
before the review this package has nice presentation and solid build .####['laptop design features', 'laptop quality']
( good ) as for the laptop ( when it worked , and i mean for the whole 30 minutes ) it was extremely fast .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
adequate screen .####['display general']
the product looks reasonable at this price range .####['laptop price']
i ' ve only had the computer for a little over a month , that is annoying on many levels .####['laptop general']
the manufacturer was not helpful in trying to resolve this issue .####['support general']
having ram problems after 1 .####['hard disc general']
i ' ve been able to play fortnite on this laptop , medium settings , with no issues or lag / stutter .####['laptop operation performance']
unfortunately i was never able to complete this task , because after booting the laptop it suddenly shut - off on me and wouldn ' t turn back on again .####['laptop operation performance']
the wall power adapter charger is not working and then later caught fire .####['power supply operation performance']
i ' m extremely disappointed with the performance of this laptop .####['laptop operation performance']
there are several traps inside and outside of laptop .####['laptop general']
keyboard is not good .####['keyboard general']
- sleek and nice texture on lid####['laptop design features']
one of the keys is especially flimsy and feels like it could break at any moment .####['keyboard quality']
it gets what you need done .####['laptop operation performance']
if you plan on buying this beware that your patience may run thin .####['laptop general']
machine is totally unusable during the update .####['laptop operation performance']
i received the item after 18 days of ordering .####['shipping general']
similarly the task tray area of the main task bar is on the small side and lends itself to fat - fingering .####['software design features']
one of the features of chromeos that i find very convenient is the way in which all of your configuration settings are stored in the cloud with your gmail account .####['os design features']
a big part of this device is its gorgeous aesthetic .####['laptop design features']
this is a great device and the $ 450 asking price seems fair .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
this computer was 10 fold what i had expected .####['laptop general']
i ' m usually peaked with ram ( ~ 95 % ) which is good because it ' s better used than not used .####['memory operation performance']
but it is a bit big and heavy .####['laptop design features']
quality is excellent so far , and the software / hardware combination works like they were made for each other ( which is what you want : ) )####['laptop quality', 'hardware operation performance', 'software operation performance']
after a week of use , i can safely say it is the most impressive chromebook i have used to - date .####['laptop general']

it ' s sturdy , and looks and feels great .####['laptop design features']
update : the c302 now supports google play store services on the stable channel .####['support general']

love the backlit keyboard .####['keyboard general']
can get pretty warm running an intensive android app for a while .####['laptop quality']
at least the volume through bluetooth was tolerable .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
this works great .####['laptop operation performance']
after two years , or almost , the worst thing about this machine is lack of printer support .####['laptop design features']
it has exceeded my expectations for performance , functionality and utility .####['laptop operation performance']
in general , it has the look and feel of a premium laptop that is at home in any situation such as sitting down with a client .####['laptop design features']
this is my third chromebook and easily the best i ' ve encountered .####['laptop general']
very expensive for what you get .####['laptop price']
it ' s lighter , good construction , chromebook works perfectly and downloaded 10 different apps i normally use for free .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
battery life is also solid .####['battery operation performance']
construction looks and feels great .####['laptop design features']
on the other hand my least favorite feature is the track pad .####['hardware general']
nice screen .####['display general']

cons : no usb ports .####['ports design features']
