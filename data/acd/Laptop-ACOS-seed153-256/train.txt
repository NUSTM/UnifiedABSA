+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####['display design features', 'laptop price']
i have been beyond pleased with this laptop purchase over the last 6 months of use .####['laptop general']
additionally , this has a nice backlight to the keyboard , which will turn off when nothing has been pressed for about 20 seconds ( great for when just watching or reading something ) or can be manually turned off entirely .####['keyboard usability']

this is a brand i look for that i feel i can trust .####['company general']
i wish the camera was a little better , but it ' s great otherwise .####['multimedia devices general', 'laptop general']
the only problem that i have found about lenovo is that it comes with a program called migration , which is supposed to migrate your things from your old computer to your new computer .####['software design features']
if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .####['laptop general']
very good purchase .####['laptop general']
the price was great during prime days .####['laptop price']
price and product , outstanding .####['laptop price']
this device ( and its brother the plus ) has a grave hardware flaw that causes the touchscreen to move on its own .####['display operation performance', 'hardware operation performance']
ridiculous for something so expensive , some internet research shows numerous people having this issue .####['laptop price']
the pixels are currently stuck .####['display operation performance']
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .####['display operation performance']
i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of keyboards and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .####['keyboard general']
it does indeed look excellent !####['display design features']
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####['laptop operation performance']
there is a power button on the side which i have accidentally hit quite a few times .####['keyboard design features']
except , you know , when it decided to become unusable .####['laptop operation performance']
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####['keyboard general', 'laptop design features']
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .####['keyboard operation performance']
no caps lock on the keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
bought this for someone else , can ' t believe how good it is .####['laptop general']
it take a bit of getting used to .####['keyboard usability']
it ' s great in many ways ; the build is solid , the screen is good ( and the resolution is insane ) , and the keyboard is decent , though only time will tell if it ' s as diet coke - resistant as the samsung ' s keys are .####['display design features', 'display general', 'laptop quality', 'keyboard design features', 'laptop general']
never has it run out of power while on battery .####['battery operation performance']
the 1080p display is very sharp .####['display operation performance']
great device for browsing the internet .####['laptop miscellaneous']
battery life is excellent , and i can get several days use before needing to plug in .####['battery operation performance']
with chrome remote desktop i am able to play turn - based video games such as hearthstone or civ 5 while miles away from the computer actually running them .####['software usability']
first of all , this is a physically beautiful machine .####['laptop design features']
i purchased this chromebook strictly for writing / editing ( i ' m an independent and published author ) and web browsing .####['laptop usability']
losing the function keys for a toucher was a deal breaker .####['keyboard design features']
i don ' t like this .####['ports general']
the keyboard is ok .####['keyboard general']
the display is excellent !####['display general']
i ventured back to the macbook pro world and purchased this model after much research .####['laptop general']
laptop in perfect condition .####['laptop general']
laptop is as described .####['laptop general']
it didn ' t come with the box but it came with the charger and so far , i ' ve only been using for a few days , but i have no issues with the item at all .####['laptop operation performance']
the display is amazing and the new force click trackpad is an awesome addition .####['keyboard general', 'display operation performance']
i love this computer .####['laptop general']
slim , very fast , great screen , lightweight , solid state drives , great battery ( even though it burns the battery life when i play my flight simulator due to processing demands of the graphics ! )####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features', 'battery operation performance', 'display general']
the pro is by far the best .####['laptop general']
i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !####['laptop general']
january 21 , 2016 update : i love this laptop even more than before .####['laptop general']
i ' ve only had it for one day and the set up was easy , and all items delivered were present , will update over time !####['os usability']
the display clarity is outstanding .####['display operation performance']
it is a great laptop !####['laptop general']
one year later and the laptop is still in great condition !####['laptop operation performance']
the macbook pro is everything i hoped for and more .####['laptop general']
very nicely packed in original box .####['shipping general']
works great !####['laptop operation performance']
the retina display is stunning .####['display general']
i bought this chromebook on the prime day deal , but even without $ 60 off it would still have been worth the money .####['laptop price']
i thought the gizmo was neat but i was disappointed that i couldn ' t really use it the way i wanted to it that regards .####['laptop operation performance']
i could even watch videos and game from the laptop itself ( to an extent ) .####['laptop usability']
that is just incredible .####['laptop general']
in preparation for becoming a chromebook user i had purchased a 256 gig memory card and moved all my laptop files to it .####['memory general']
every app i have downloaded from the google app store has worked perfectly .####['software operation performance']
i fixed it , however it took intensive research to fix it .####['laptop general']
as it turned out the thunderbolt ports are of no use .####['ports usability']
the machine looks amazing doesn ' t it !####['laptop general']
i ' m pretty sure i ordered the biggest size , and i got the smaller one , but whatever it shipped fast and it works great .####['laptop operation performance', 'shipping general']
have not heard any complaints about the product .####['laptop general']
- for such a premium price , this is definitely the worst purchase quality wise that i have made .####['laptop price', 'laptop quality']
your new retina screen will get stains on it from the top layer seperating and or dead pixels .####['display quality']
i originally purchased this at the beginning of april after about a week it stopped charging ( would receive ` ` low power charger ` ` connected message and not charge ) .####['power supply operation performance']
but this asus , who offered so much & rated over 4 stars , turned to a black screen , just over a month after i received it .####['laptop operation performance']
we ' ve got android nougat on beta running pretty well now .####['os operation performance']
the c302 is clean and feels solid .####['laptop design features']
this is a nice perk to save battery life and for folks who like to read / / browse late at night in bed and do n ' t want the backlighting on .####['keyboard design features']
and apparently amazon is experiencing a supply shortage because my replacement isn ' t expected until sometime between jan 11th to feb 5th !####['support general']
i loved this chromebook , it worked great for six months .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
now the romance is over ; it won ' t charge , and my only option is to send it in for service , a 10 - day event not including shipping there and back .####['power supply operation performance']
i also decided that despite the advantages of the asus , i can not live with the sharp edges and middling volume .####['laptop design features', 'laptop general']
aluminum outer body , usb c charging from either side of the chrombooke , backit keyboard , nice screen resolution and fast processor .####['cpu operation performance']
i can plug it in and put it back to sleep and it will charge , but if i haven ' t woken it up it won ' t begin to charge .####['laptop operation performance']
the main bad for this particular variant is that google is no longer going to support it with updates .####['support general']
so be forwarded , if you buy this , you are jumping right into a machine that won ' t get updates anymore ( which is something most chromebook owners want and a feature that makes them better than android and it ' s fragmented market ) .####['laptop general']
but today i noticed it ' s cracking ( ref : pics ) .####['laptop operation performance']
it is the nicest chrome computer i have ever owned .####['laptop general']
it surfs the internet fast .####['laptop connectivity']
the key board and mouse pad are not very sensitive .####['keyboard quality']
cursor won ' t move and touchscreen won ' t work and from reading about this online i am not alone with this issue .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance']
nice screen , nice feel .####['display quality']
chromebook is 2 months old and charger stopped working .####['power supply operation performance']
i still love the laptop , i ' m just a bit disappointed by this and i hope it ' s the only issue i see .####['laptop general']
moreover i ' m quite upset because it seems amazon will not pay me back the shipping fees , which for me amount to about 100 $ as i live in france .####['shipping general']
i much suspect that google ' s half baked sustem is at fault .####['os general']
the first week i had my chromebook it locked up .####['laptop operation performance']
this product is built well , but it won ' t run the one android app i hoped it would run , and for whatever reason the app and os update download speeds are abysmal .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
i loved this chromebook but i had to return it bevause it had sound issues .####['multimedia devices operation performance', 'laptop general']
but after three charge cycles the screen started vibrating vigorously from side - to - side .####['display operation performance']
manufacturing seems unreliable .####['laptop quality']
the screen is great and the unit is fast .####['laptop operation performance', 'display general']
everything was good for a few days after receiving the product .####['laptop general']
very disappointing in an otherwise great product####['laptop general']
very fast product , but with this kind of technology it ' s not possible to use a program , that i work ( minitab ) .####['laptop operation performance']
it simply refuses to boot .####['laptop quality']
laptop runs really well but fans get a bit loud when gaming####['laptop operation performance', 'fans&cooling operation performance']
however , i tried to power it up today and kept receiving an error message right at startup that was a ` ` system boot violation ` ` .####['laptop operation performance']
it only comes with 8 gb or ram not 16 .####['memory design features']
the keys feel nice and responsive however the mouse pad is a little over responsive .####['keyboard general', 'hardware operation performance']
the monitor looks fantastic , but i still cant get over the fact that you are basically lied to aboit memory availability .####['display design features', 'memory general']
the computer ' s hardware is decent , but the materials are poor .####['hardware general', 'laptop quality']
do not buy this computer !####['laptop general']
cpu and gpu are good , ram is good and i like the keyboard .####['keyboard general', 'memory general', 'cpu general', 'graphics general']
its battery life is really good , and the led lights are nice .####['battery operation performance', 'display general']
do not buy this .####['laptop general']
don ' t recommend it .####['laptop general']
- caps lock without a led notification , not so clever .####['keyboard design features']
quiet keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
the only thing i don ' t like is that the power button sits beside the delete key .####['keyboard design features']
good screen .####['display general']
the screen on this looks great , the bezels aren ' t noticeable .####['display design features', 'laptop design features']
i bought this laptop for software development .####['laptop general']
the notebook is very well built and it could easily pass as a high - end machine .####['laptop quality', 'laptop general']
only thing i ' d change would be the hard drive .####['hard disc general']
purchased this mid november , because of the 8th gen i5 , and other good specs for the great price .####['laptop price', 'cpu general', 'laptop general']
what this tells me is that the hdmi port on my chromebook is defective .####['ports connectivity']
i can ' t really testify to its battery - life as i have not used it to the point where the battery is totally dissipated .####['battery operation performance']
i have mixed feelings about this acer chromebook .####['laptop general']
now my main complaint is that is it very slow , especially for a new computer !####['laptop operation performance']
computer was used very little and stopped working after 6 months####['laptop operation performance']
i ' ve had it for less than two months it randomly shuts down .####['laptop operation performance']
trackpad keeps breaking .####['hardware operation performance']
11 months after the purchase , it died .####['laptop general']
the touchpad is quite sensitive i ' ve noticed , not a big issue to me .####['hardware operation performance']
the laptop build is cheap looking and basic , but functional to say the least while i save up money .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop quality']
below medium build quality####['laptop quality']
about 4 hours of battery####['battery operation performance']
it ' s fast at processing , fast for web browsing and has a quick startup .####['laptop operation performance']
after the ssd upgrade , the computer is very fast .####['laptop operation performance', 'hard disc operation performance']
the hard drive sounds like a distant lawn mower .####['hard disc operation performance']
this thing is slow !####['laptop operation performance']
this is a painfully slow computer .####['laptop operation performance']
- track pad is accurate####['hardware operation performance']
they are clearly working with more than one person at a time , and not effective multi - taskers .####['support general']
also tech support gave incorrect product info !####['support general']
with my first day of use everything was terribly slow and updates took hours .####['laptop operation performance']
this computer completely shut down after 2 months .####['laptop quality']
it felt flimsy , but decent .####['laptop design features', 'laptop general']
windows 10 alone runs slow on this but once you install some 3rd party programs like adobe photoshop or illistrator , this laptop is unuseable .####['laptop operation performance', 'os operation performance']
i ' ve been waiting for this chromebook for some time now and having only had it for about two weeks , i can say that the device and purchase were well worth it .####['laptop general']
the surface texture of the case is a satiny paper - like touch , which is both clean and easy to wipe down , but also not so smooth that you have to be concerned with it slipping out of your hand when carrying it .####['laptop design features', 'laptop usability']
- backlit keyboard rocks####['keyboard design features']
it was an excellent machine for the money and it also got me spoiled with its touch screen .####['laptop price', 'display operation performance']
the default scaling 1536x864 looks excellent and sharp to me .####['display operation performance']
i ' m typing this review in a dark room , and it reminds me how much i love this backlit keyboard .####['keyboard operation performance']
again , this is where the build quality really shines .####['laptop quality']
the addition of the play store puts the device into a sweet spot no other device can come close to matching .####['laptop design features']
one , the display is gorgeous ; watching video is a treat .####['display operation performance']
the core m3 allows this system to get fast and to stay quiet .####['cpu operation performance']
boot speed : likewise , very fast -####['os operation performance']
everything is either good or excellent in quality .####['laptop quality']
- the keyboard is great and has a nice gentle / quiet click to it .####['keyboard general', 'keyboard usability']
the display is perfect for me , plenty of brightness and a decent resolution .####['display design features', 'display general']
the usb - c ports are nice and i found that a completely dead battery to fully charged time was about an hour .####['power supply operation performance', 'ports general']
* battery - i can not really speak to the battery life yet , but as a power user with lots of tabs and several apps open , it is giving me a days use 5 + hours of use so far .####['battery operation performance']
it ' s one of the best chromebook in the market if not the best .####['laptop general']
i love my c302 !####['laptop general']
love the keyboard more than its predecessor .####['keyboard general']
only problem i have had , which was from the moment i started using it is the audio .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
nice build quality , very fast and beautiful display .####['laptop quality', 'display general']
the computer itself is sturdy and feels well - made , though the keyboard is a bit smaller than i ' m used to .####['laptop design features', 'keyboard design features']
i knocked off a star for build quality control .####['laptop quality']
the display is clear .####['display operation performance']
battery life appears to be pretty good too .####['battery general']
i really like this chromebook .####['laptop general']
this is a great device if your main goal is to check email , surf the internet listen to music or watch videos .####['laptop general']
i have to say that the keyboard is my favorite feature .####['keyboard general']
i purchased this machine on cyber monday for $ 375 ( $ 75 off the listing price at the time of this review ) and i think at that price point , it ' s well worth it .####['laptop quality']
the startup time is ridiculously fast , and just opening the laptop will turn it on and get you going on chrome within 10 seconds - i ' ve had as many as 12 tabs open , and it still ran smoothly .####['software operation performance', 'os operation performance']
outstanding laptop .####['laptop general']
track pad is passable .####['keyboard general']
so i went ahead and ordered the c302ca , and after a week of use there are no issues to report .####['laptop general']
i ' m loving this thing .####['laptop general']
i like it , good construction , can load android apps .####['laptop design features']
great display .####['display general']
the speakers are not great , but bluetooth connection to an external speaker is standard these days and it ' s how we watch movies .####['ports connectivity']
overall , i am very happy with this purchase , and i am in love with the simplicity of the google ecosystem .####['out of scope usability', 'laptop general']
i ' d say the only drawback might be the speakers .####['multimedia devices general']
the keyboard is also one of the nicest most comfortable i have ever used .####['keyboard usability']
overall it has been a wonder experience and quality product .####['laptop quality']
the keyboard has excellent travel and just feels right .####['keyboard operation performance']
the volume and backlit - keyboard brightness controls also do not work properly .####['multimedia devices operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance']
i have to say , this is a very nice product .####['laptop general']
this asus worked right out of the box and was very responsive .####['laptop operation performance']
i didn ' t want to spend much on this as it is my first laptop , but i was convinced by a few reviews to upgrade to this model as it has more ram and performs better in several areas .####['laptop operation performance']
an awesome product , well built - well worth your time and money .####['laptop quality', 'laptop general']
the keyboard is nice to type on .####['keyboard operation performance']
