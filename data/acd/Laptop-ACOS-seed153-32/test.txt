the unit cost $ 275 to start with , so it is not worth repairing .####['laptop price']
going from acer 15 to acer 11 was difficult , 11 inches seems too small for me .####['laptop design features']
also it ' s not a true ssd drive in there but emmc , which makes a difference .####['hard disc operation performance']
the computer has difficulty switching between tablet and computer .####['laptop usability']
2 / 28 / 18 - a couple days ago i updated the chrome os .####['os general']
it ' s just that chrome doesn ' t work the same with a chromebook as it does with windows .####['os operation performance']
hopefully in 10 years they ' ll have this figured out and it won ' t suck so badly .####['laptop general']
bought this last year on july .####['laptop general']
i rarely use the keyboard .####['keyboard general']
- great price for a touchscreen chromebook####['laptop price']
it is glitchy , and barely usable .####['hardware operation performance']
i ordered one , the touch pad failed to work consistently .####['hardware operation performance']
i often find i ' ve typed an entire sentence ( or more ) with my fingers on the wrong keys , which is very unproductive when trying to take real - time notes in a meeting !####['keyboard general']
i know it only takes a few seconds , but a new device should not be doing this and makes me question if it ' ll get worse in the future .####['laptop general']
i also have to press the trackpad very hard for left click ( not as badly as the first unit , though ) , and i lost right click functionality on the track pad 2 days into my voyage with this thing .####['keyboard usability']
i tried factory resetting after i updated the os , and it still drained 9 % over 8 hours .####['os general']
hdmi out doesn ' t work right .####['ports quality']
they had it over a week and then shipped back .####['support general']
i was excited to receive this chromebook , only to watch that excitement dissipate within mere hours as i noticed the touchscreen did n ' t work at all on tablet mode .####['hardware operation performance']
clearly there is some kind of major defect here that acer has n ' t resolved .####['company general']
i bought this for my daughter to use to take online classes while she ' s overseas in europe for a year .####['laptop general']
decent sound quality .####['multimedia devices quality']
flimsy power adapter .####['power supply general']
wi - fi slows down to crowl and speeds back up intermittently .####['ports quality']
regret buying it at times .####['laptop general']
it just turned off and will not turn back on .####['laptop quality']
the product is great , but the customer support is horrible .####['support general', 'laptop general']
called support a second time after 10 minutes of verifying some type of info they told me to call google without even trying to help .####['support general']
but i ' m getting into photography now , and it ' s terrible for loading , storing , and editing pictures .####['laptop operation performance']
i have sent it in twice already and waiting for it to come back .####['laptop general']
the screen looked great .####['display general']
no matter how many times i reinserted the charging adapter , i kept getting this message .####['power supply operation performance']
i had no option but to shut down the computer , unplug it , plug it back in , and then reboot .####['laptop operation performance']
it has worked well except for an initial hiccup on turning it on .####['laptop operation performance']
the screen flashes for a second every 30 seconds or so .####['display operation performance']
i noticed the battery went down to 67 % for no reason .####['battery operation performance']
works good but the fan kicks in pretty often , which is to keep the laptop cool but the sound is annoying .####['fans&cooling operation performance']
nano edge display is nice .####['display operation performance']
everything was fine and i went out for an hour .####['laptop general']
the audio is almost impossible to hear .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
it is slow to do everything .####['laptop operation performance']
here ' s the kicker : it is doing a terrible job running dragon age .####['laptop operation performance']
it doesn ' t has backlit keyboard : ( typing in low light is such a pain .####['keyboard design features']
very disappointed in how slow it seems .####['laptop operation performance']
keyboard and mouse pad seem fine , but overall it seems strangely slow .####['keyboard design features', 'laptop general']
i have been using this for just 3 months .####['laptop general']
crazy keypad : this issue is even worse .####['keyboard general']
overall , the laptop has a solid feel to it .####['laptop general']
this lead me to believe that although i purchased a “ new ” product , they sent me a refurbished one instead .####['laptop quality']
i ' m out from us , i live in colombia , and maybe i can not return these laptop .####['laptop general']
i like the speed , the processor the hybrid storage units ( 128ssd and 1tera ) , but the web cam sucks , really poor resolution and the keyboard doesn ' t have the numerical part and the caps lock or num lock don ' t have any light or guide to help you .####['keyboard design features', 'cpu operation performance', 'hardware operation performance', 'memory general']
lightweight .####['laptop design features']
yesterday the backlight went out .####['keyboard operation performance']
it was brand new out of the box , i ' ve never dropped it .####['laptop general']
now i have to deal with warranty stuff and sending it back etc .####['warranty general']
ram upgrade available####['hardware general']
hard drive upgrade available####['memory operation performance']
i had issues with the touchpad sticking or not responding to click correctly from the start .####['hardware operation performance']
it ' s still a mainly functional computer , but using it is just not the greatest .####['laptop general']
we ' ve had the computer for 5 weeks , used it a total of less than 20 hours , and now it will be gone for 3 weeks .####['laptop general']
i send it to asus warranty and now after a week they ' re sending it back stating the no problem was found .####['support general']
display stop working within 2 months .####['display general']
since it came with no user manual , i had to call asus customer support and got someone who knew all about windows 10 software but nothing about my asus notebook .####['support operation performance']
after reading all the bad reviews , just sent it back for a refund .####['laptop quality']
all over this asus laptop which has a non - functioning touchpad .####['hardware quality', 'laptop general']
my screen broke when just putting a textbook on it .####['display general']
don ' t even bother calling customer support , in my experience , they do you no good .####['support general']
keyboard needs to be redesigned entirely .####['keyboard design features']
6 ` ` screen is big enough to read with ease , yet the item itself is light enough to tote to meetings .####['laptop portability', 'display design features']
so far , this looks as if it meets my needs as a good ` ` work machine . ` `####['laptop general']
after exactly one year of useage this computer completely stopped working .####['laptop operation performance']
it boots up in 10 seconds and shuts down in 2 to 3 seconds .####['laptop operation performance']
i like the idea that the keyboard lights up and has a ` ` time out ` ` feature to shut off .####['keyboard design features']
it seems put together well .####['laptop general']
what they lack in size , they make up for in raw speed , durability , and energy efficiency .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
+ decent quantity of available ports####['ports quality']
+ it has a dvd drive : o####['optical drives general']
- it runs hot !####['laptop quality']
running grid benchmark , it got to a high 92 / 93 degrees c !####['laptop quality']
- new i5 mobile processor .####['cpu general']
- ddr4 ram that is upgradable .####['memory general']
- very decent battery life .####['battery operation performance']
so far i am pleasantly impressed with this unit , however i have not used it a long time or tested many applications to date .####['laptop general']
i can certainly say this is the best laptop i ' ve ever had ( but then again i ' ve only had 3 , and you would expect these things to improve over time , right ) .####['laptop general']
i ' ve been using it for at least 4 hours since last charged in that 23 % used up .####['laptop operation performance']
- as others have mentioned , the keyboard backlight turns off after just a few seconds of not typing , which can be annoying and there doesn ' t seem to be a way to change this .####['keyboard operation performance']
- easily upgradeable ram####['memory usability']
one feature that i love is the ability to disable the touchpad from the keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
it ' s not fancy , but it ' s good value and fast and trouble - free .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
after spending some time with it , the feature can really be useful .####['keyboard design features']
easily upgrade to storage and ram .####['memory usability']
this does not really matter to me because the mx150 is enough for my needs .####['graphics design features']
i love the solid state drive , as reviews or ads say you can boot up and get onto internet in 10 to 15 seconds .####['hard disc general']
it ' s not a ` ` gaming ` ` laptop even it can do some more casual gaming .####['laptop general']
it ' s super fast , boots up in seconds .####['laptop operation performance']
i am very impressed with this system .####['os operation performance']
mastercam itself runs pretty good .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
as usual amazon was great about returning it .####['support quality']
screen is decent , not great , it is matte finished .####['display design features']
i like the back lit keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
it ' s a lot of good for a comparatively cheap price .####['laptop price']
the screen is perfectly adequate .####['display operation performance']
this thing boots up super quick and it sleek and beautiful .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
google and partners have done great with chromebooks and have plenty of features to accommodate .####['company general']
i would highly recommend this to anyone , but especially to someone wanting something that is affordable , easy to use and just a bit more than a tablet .####['laptop usability', 'laptop price']
i ' m getting very used to the multiple finger shortcuts on the touch pad when navigating chrome .####['keyboard usability']
this thing is still fantastic for what it is .####['laptop general']
i chose to purchase a samsung chromebook this time just to try out a different company and because it was inexpensive ( i paid $ 189 .####['laptop price']
i couldn ' t be happier with this product !####['laptop general']
the screen hinge is super strong and it ' s hard to imagine it breaking unless you dropped it .####['display quality']
the size is perfect , it ' s easy to toss it in my satchel or backpack along with my textbook and notebooks and have plenty of room .####['laptop design features', 'laptop portability']
works great right out of the box , as advertised .####['laptop operation performance']
the battery life on this seems good .####['battery operation performance']
this chromebook instantly connects to the internet .####['laptop connectivity']
going to a grocery store or fitness center , the android tablets took so long to connect that i finished my shopping before they came online .####['laptop connectivity']
everything is perfect .####['laptop general']
powers up immediately , great battery life , great keyboard , amazing features .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance', 'battery general', 'keyboard general']
was considering an apple product but i ' m much happier with this !####['laptop general']
this is my third samsung chromebook and i will continue to use this brand .####['company general', 'laptop general']
does not act like a tablet , but it can have almost 10 tabs open before affecting performance , including video streaming .####['laptop operation performance']
this was purchased for my son to download his high school textbooks for use .####['laptop usability']
great price for a good book used for college students who carry all day####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
i bought this refurbished and haven ' t experienced any issues .####['laptop general']
this laptop is very straight forward .####['laptop general']
otherwise , it ' s great .####['laptop general']
also , secure os .####['os operation performance']
the product itself is awesome .####['laptop general']
great little laptop and tablet !####['laptop general']
the chormebook works as described by seller .####['laptop operation performance']
i like the size and features .####['laptop design features']
however , still 5 stars as you get what you pay for : a cheap , decently rugged , light weight notebook to kick around and tinker with .####['laptop design features', 'laptop price']
love the keyboard .####['keyboard general']
i am still getting use to the chromebook but i love it lightweight easy to bring with me as it doesnt take up much room !####['laptop design features', 'laptop general']
i am so glad i purchased this and would definitely purchase again .####['laptop general']
since it is the same platform used at school the navigation was easy to get used too .####['software usability']
great for going on the internet .####['laptop operation performance']
it works well for her .####['laptop operation performance']
we ran world of tank blitz ( using a game controller ) and roblocks on the low rez settings and experienced great appearance and ability to play .####['laptop operation performance']
another little thing is the speaker isn ' t loud .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
love it####['laptop general']
great battery life .####['battery operation performance']
easy to take with and do homework on the go too !####['laptop portability']
i would recommend it to anyone .####['laptop general']
this is perfect .####['laptop general']
battery life , speed , display and software were my additional top reasons why i went for the samsung .####['display general', 'laptop operation performance', 'battery general', 'software general']
the display is crisp and bright , setup literally takes under a minute , its fast , cheap , charges fast , lasts forever .####['os operation performance', 'power supply operation performance', 'display quality']
nice , i ordered this just for simple web browsing and personal use .####['laptop general']
i love my chromebook .####['laptop general']
it is taking me a while to get used to the small , tight keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
after researching for a high quality laptop that would not break the bank , i finally chose this one .####['laptop quality']
delivery was a bit off but i blame usps on that , they suck in my area .####['shipping general']
amd a12 processor is quite fast when loading everything from an ssd .####['cpu operation performance']
light for its size , not much flex in the body .####['laptop design features']
stop what you ' re doing now and get this computer !####['laptop general']
this computer is the best thing you can get under 400 dollars .####['laptop price']
great functioning computer .####['laptop general']
excellent laptop at a reasonable price .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
this laptop does all i need it to do .####['laptop general']
works flawlessly and decent battery life .####['battery operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
excelente laptop####['laptop general']
great for graphics , nothing to complex but it can get the job done####['graphics general']
about what i was expecting / hoping it to be .####['laptop general']
it has been able to handle everything i ' ve needed for my business .####['laptop general']
it is fast enough for what we do , and it has all the features we needed for less .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
love our new laptop .####['laptop general']
battery could last longer .####['battery quality']
light weight , good battery life , sharp screen .####['laptop design features', 'display design features', 'battery general']
he is very content with it and its features####['laptop general']
great performance , quiet and cool processor .####['laptop operation performance', 'cpu general']
the sims 4 ran very smoothly on regular graphics .####['display operation performance']
i was really excited to get this laptop !####['laptop general']
runs first person shooters relatively well .####['software operation performance']
would definitely buy this again if i needed to do so .####['laptop general']
laptop booted right up and the set up waa super easy .####['laptop usability', 'laptop operation performance']
the ones that do , doesn ' t have the numbering pad on the right side of the keyboard and i needed that .####['keyboard design features']
it ' s a very good lappy and i ' m happy with it , because it can still get all i need to do , done .####['laptop general']
nice and thin , light , surprised it has a dvd player in it .####['laptop design features', 'laptop general']
for my needs it ' s a perfect computer with one major flaw : battery life is much shorter than they advertise !####['battery operation performance', 'laptop general']
mine did lose its screen backlight suddenly when i ' d had it less than a month .####['display quality']
fast processor .####['cpu operation performance']
if you want a laptop ( not for gaming - reviews say - i have not tried ) get this one !####['laptop general']
i think the battery is just undersized for the amd a12 apu .####['battery design features']
this is an excellent laptop with a lot of heart .####['laptop general']
the dvd player is a really nice touch as well , i didn ' t think i would use it but i definitely will in the future !####['optical drives general']
has all the available ports that i need .####['ports general']
laptop is very fast with 4cpu and 8gpu on board .####['laptop operation performance']
great computer , you can play 2015 and below games on this computer .####['laptop general']
great laptop !####['laptop general']
she can stream music or videos , do her homework , and so on , so we are all pleased with our purchase .####['laptop general']
cpu performance does well .####['cpu operation performance']
i bought this for college to do my homework and also pay my bills .####['laptop general']
really like it .####['laptop general']
played heroes of the storm with graphics up full and wasn ' t any lag .####['graphics operation performance']
webpages load quickly .####['software operation performance']
but i guess , it ' s got a lot of power going to that processor so you can ' t have it all .####['cpu operation performance']
for us , it was perfect .####['laptop general']
i got ta say this was my first ever online computer / laptop order and let me tell you its pretty good .####['laptop general']
i love how sleek and thin it is .####['laptop design features']
great feel to the keyboard as well .####['keyboard usability']
this is a super fast computer and i really like it .####['laptop operation performance']
it ' s so far a solid laptop that i can use for some gaming and school .####['laptop general']
i purchased the laptop in august , and i already have a couple of keys popping off .####['laptop general']
i almost always keep it plugged in , so i can ' t comment on battery life .####['battery general']
battery life is short , but plugging it in works .####['battery operation performance']
sleek design .####['laptop design features']
easy to use .####['laptop usability']
nice computer for responsible grade school child .####['laptop general']
this laptop is well engineered and designed .####['laptop design features']
this is a very nice laptop .####['laptop general']
it is perfect for everything i need it for .####['laptop general']
provided just what i wanted at a resonable price .####['laptop price']
this laptop is fast and does what i need without problems .####['laptop operation performance']
great price and great performance but terrible battery .####['laptop price', 'laptop operation performance', 'battery general']
it is a little slow .####['laptop operation performance']
great computer , setup was fast and easy .####['laptop usability', 'laptop general']
i am inlove with this laptop literally , it ' s nice size 15 .####['laptop design features']
graphics are good for the level of this laptop .####['graphics general']
finally got the warranty honored after almost 6 months .####['warranty general']
plenty of buyer returned it since the touch screen has phantom touch problems right after unboxing or it will eventually happen within 3 months .####['display quality']
consequently , i am no longer covered and my otherwise great chromebook becomes unusable anytime the phantom touches appear .####['keyboard general', 'laptop general']
i have tried to fix the pixel with online videos and websites with no effect .####['display operation performance']
the beautiful screen is said to be identical to the pixelbook in size , aspect ratio , and resolution .####['display design features']
after using the 3 : 2 aspect ratio , i think i prefer it to normal 16 : 9 , as far as chromebooks go .####['display design features']
it was fine for a solid two days , from there on it has been nonstop , reset to factory settings .####['laptop operation performance']
idk if that ' s how chromeos usually is , or maybe there is something wrong with the hardware but this is very annoying .####['hardware quality']
i get that this is meant to store everything in the cloud so it should be no big deal , but when your trying to get work done where there is no access to the internet ( since google docs works offline ) it is practically useless when it has to reset itself to factory settings just after turning it on .####['os design features']
the touch screen works wonderfully .####['display operation performance']
as others have noted , the backspace key is small .####['keyboard design features']
my biggest irk today though is that the screen is not very durable .####['display quality']
hard reboot , reset , refresh + power , esc + refresh + power , charging , letting it drain , nothing brought it back to life .####['laptop usability']
needless to say trip number three to best buy was a pure return , since being 0 / 2 on such an expensive device leaves a bad taste , you know ?####['laptop price']
gorgeous screen , small profile , lightweight , built in stylus , i could go on and on about how awesome this thing was .####['laptop design features', 'hardware design features', 'display design features']
this review might be dismissed as i am missing the ` ` verified purchase ` ` stamp , which is fair .####['support general']
i wouldn ' t recommend this as a starting computer for children because they ' d learn incorrect navigation and have to adapt later to standard laptops .####['laptop operation performance']
look , dont buy it .####['laptop general']
the screen does look good .####['display general']
terrible quality and not really enjoyable to use apps on the playstore .####['laptop quality', 'software general']
battery life its ok .####['battery general']
then i got it home , worked with it for awhile , and realized just how easy it is to misfire unless you land dead nuts center in the middle of the key on your stroke .####['keyboard general']
another star off for android app support , which simply isn ' t ready for prime time .####['software quality']
i didn ' t find a single android app that was optimized for chrome os ( not that my search was exhaustive , admittedly ) , so was disappointed pretty much every time .####['software design features']
battery life was mediocre , too , come to think of it .####['battery general']
amazon gave me the option of returning for refund or trying to have it repaired .####['support general']
battery is good , display and keyboard are pretty great .####['display general', 'battery general', 'keyboard general']
there ' s nothing ` ` pro ` ` about this tablet .####['laptop general']
unless it ' s a really bad baby and chromeos + samsung = bad baby !####['company general', 'laptop general']
sounds nice until you realize that your computer just doesn ' t let you do things and then calls it secure .####['laptop design features']
the keyboard lacks a backlight which is inconvenient in low light situations .####['keyboard usability']
when you stack up all these strengths and offer them at a price of $ 299 , you ' re getting a fairly impressive value proposition here with this chromebook .####['laptop price']
at $ 300 , this is a great purchase .####['laptop price']
which leads me to my next point , the omnipresent comments about ` ` this feels like a $ 1000 computer ! ` `####['laptop price']
this isn ' t say the acer is bad in the abstract ; far from it .####['company general']
it has a nice , oversize trackpad that - like pretty much all chromebooks - is responsive and a pleasure to use .####['keyboard design features', 'keyboard operation performance']
the performance never lags , it meets the 10 - 12 hour battery life promise in my usage tests , and it ' s quickly become my go - to computer for both home and work .####['battery operation performance']
this unit not only has a nice aluminum shell ( which is very attractive ) , but it also has a decent keyboard , with much better tactile properties than any chromebooks i ' ve looked at in the past .####['laptop design features']
when i was comparing this model against other manufacturer ' s / model ' s , the only thing that made me pause was the lack of a card reader / writer .####['ports general']
i love it !####['laptop general']
this isn ' t a powerhouse , i ' ve never pushed it , it probably wouldn ' t handle the 20 + tabs over multiple windows / desktops that i ' m used to on chrome on the desktop , but for 99 % of ` ` regular people ` ` this is an unbelievably good laptop .####['laptop operation performance']
the battery life is incredible and charges from 0 % to 100 % in about an hour and a half while in use .####['battery operation performance']
overall , it performs well enough for my daily internet needs .####['laptop operation performance']
my only wish is that it were a little more quick / less laggy given it is a chromebook - but for the price point its a great buy .####['laptop price']
little bit of a learning curve with chrome os .####['os general']
so it appears the play store does not recognize this devise at this time .####['laptop usability']
chromebook seems like the kind of device that you review after a few weeks , and by the time anything happens to it that affects use , the replacement will be just as much or cheaper , twice as powerful , and come with ` ` angry birds ` ` installed by default .####['laptop general']
the hdmi and usb ports are on the left side , the back has no ports at all , and , misery !####['ports design features']
the initial feel for this chromebook is superb .####['laptop general']
the quad - core celeron n3160 gets a respectable near - 8000 octane score .####['cpu operation performance']
this is a solid , well - balanced design .####['laptop design features']
first time chromebook user , and this has been my favorite laptop ever .####['laptop general']
i ' m been quite pleased at how well the chromebook has worked for all these tasks .####['laptop operation performance']
as for software , chromeos is a decent thin - client operating system which can do more than most people think .####['os usability']
i was hesitant at first because of the price , but i have to say that this is honestly an amazing machine .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
secondly , this is a really aesthetically pleasing machine .####['laptop design features']
there are , as with everything , several growth opportunities for this model .####['laptop general']
secondly , the trackpad feels a bit delicate .####['keyboard quality']
the battery is good .####['battery general']
if you are looking for a laptop to check emails , watch movies , to shop , basic documentation , then this is an ideal one .####['laptop operation performance']
i have had q & a on this chromebook asking if it will download ms office .####['laptop usability']
battery seems to be pretty good .####['battery general']
with the slow celeron processor , browsing does not feel snappy .####['cpu operation performance']
this is my second chromebook and my next purchase will be a chromebase to replace my home pc .####['laptop general']
it does everything that i need and is surprisingly fast .####['laptop operation performance']
i want to cry because this doesn ' t support google play store !####['laptop design features']
i ' m a graphic designer / gamer and my creative software operates with no problems and i ' m able to play the sims 4 and world of warcraft on very high settings with no problems at all .####['graphics operation performance']
this is a huge plus !####['laptop portability']
- drives are now solid state drive .####['hard disc general']
- new built - in speakers .####['multimedia devices design features']
- no dvd drive .####['multimedia devices general']
i couldn ' t drag - and - drop items in it , but after i changed the behavior in settings , everything went well from there .####['hardware operation performance']
it is pretty light if you are coming from any other laptop .####['laptop portability']
very sharp screen and good viewing angles .####['display general']
something about os x running with a high resolution display just looks classy in a way that a windows computer could never match .####['os general', 'display operation performance']
no complaints here .####['battery general']
this computer is blazing fast .####['laptop operation performance']
with os x yosemite , the os is very refined and elegant .####['os operation performance']
the laptop works great and the package was delivered on time .####['shipping general', 'laptop operation performance']
this thing is fast and efficient .####['laptop operation performance']
this computer is very high quality , do not believe anything on the market can touch it .####['laptop quality']
the backlighting is comparable , but the mbp gets brighter .####['keyboard design features', 'keyboard general']
the thunderbolt ports are a nice thing to have on the mbp .####['ports design features']
the best laptop i ' ve owned .####['laptop general']
bought it for my grandson for college and he loves it .####['laptop general']

it is thinner , and lighter .####['laptop design features']
awesome computer .####['laptop general']
the shipping was fast and the seller was great####['shipping operation performance', 'support general']
the mac is great besides a chip under the mouse pad .####['keyboard design features', 'laptop general']

yeah the new mac book is lighter and only a little small but the internals are a lot slower .####['laptop design features', 'hardware design features']
love this computer !####['laptop general']
force touch trackpad , pretty freakin awesome .####['keyboard general']
works like a charm and the retina display is super gorgeous .####['display operation performance']
the laptop arrived in excellent condition .####['shipping operation performance']
i absolutely love the programs that come with it ; how the mac itself functions , the appearance and quality of the mac .####['software general']
battery life thus far isn ' t nearly as long as i thought it would be , based upon video reviews of this model and item description .####['battery operation performance']
this macbook is such a blessing and i would feel somewhat lost without it .####['laptop general']
if you ' re considering getting this macbook , proceed with confidence .####['laptop general']
the ss hard drive has next to zero lag over traditional drives .####['hard disc operation performance']
it ' s far away from meeting my expectations .####['laptop general']
i really like how it isn ' t bulky .####['laptop design features']
great price and customer service####['laptop price', 'support general']
however , i have an iphone and an ipad and the macbook does a great job syncing up everything on all three devises .####['laptop usability']
laptop works perfect however i did get a used charger that only lasted a week .####['power supply quality', 'laptop operation performance']
awesome machine .####['laptop general']
costs a few bucks $ $ $ more but apple products are the best on the market .####['company general']
this computer is great for playing videos in a classroom setting of 10 people , connecting to an hdmi tv to show videos and powerpoints , and has a fantastic battery life .####['laptop operation performance', 'battery quality']
great price .####['laptop price']

i ' ve been using this laptop for 1 year and no issues with the deliver nor the computer .####['laptop general']
great prodcut####['laptop general']
i did not like the new 2016 model due to the lack of ports and magsafe connector .####['laptop design features']
shipping was fast and product came as described .####['shipping operation performance', 'laptop general']
apple updates are easy .####['software usability']
it arrived in great condition , and it ' s been working perfectly for me since i got it .####['laptop operation performance']
high quaility computer in every way .####['laptop quality']
i like this machine quite a bit .####['laptop general']
i was initially a little nervous as the system was somewhat glitchy for the first couple of weeks , seemed to be a problem with the chrome os because it was fixed by the next update .####['os usability', 'os quality']
took a week or so to get used to , but love it now .####['laptop general']
screen stays in whatever position you put it solidly enough to use the touchscreen .####['display design features']
battery : solid .####['battery quality']
- speakers are a little tinny ( though the volume is awesome ) and it ' s not possible to customize the equalizer on the chrome os right now : (####['os operation performance', 'multimedia devices quality', 'multimedia devices design features']
i mean , if you want a true tablet , buy a true tablet - - this did honestly keep me from investing in a kindle as i was planning to .####['laptop design features']
i love that it is only as big as it needs to be to have a full - size keyboard ( not with a number pad , but full - sized keys ) .####['keyboard design features', 'laptop design features']
update it as soon as you turn it on !####['software usability']
my trusty windows 7 laptop was on its last leg and i opted to try something new .####['laptop general']
however , it comes with 100 gb of free google drive online storage .####['hard disc design features']
the touchscreen looks good and is responsive , and the keyboard is nice .####['display general', 'display operation performance', 'keyboard general']
people who complain that chromebooks are useless without internet access clearly are narrow minded and simply not thinking outside the box .####['ports general']
so i went to install my favorite screenwriting app , trelby , only to find its not available .####['software general']
maybe this thing does suck without an internet connection .####['laptop connectivity']
and just like that , i realized that i can use my studio desktop wherever i want , whenever i want .####['laptop general']
it does make quite a loud click when you depress the button .####['keyboard design features']
overall : i like it and am happy for paying a bit over $ 200 for the 4gb model ( at the time of writing this , it sells for $ 220 new ) .####['laptop price']
one plus i ' m particularly happy about : a quiet fan - less device that doesn ' t heat up too much !####['fans&cooling quality']
i have to say , i was somewhat hesitant purchasing this chromebook mainly because of some of the reviews .####['laptop quality']
due to the excellent return policy on prime i decided to purchase this .####['support general']
i downloaded pandora and listened to all my stations at 3 / 4 volume and it sounded fine .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
so far all but 1 of the android apps that i have tried have functioned properly , but some are restricted in the size of window that will work properly .####['software operation performance']
laptop arrived dirty ( grimy screen and there was actual pet hair in the air vent ) .####['fans&cooling general', 'laptop design features', 'display design features']
i had to look up keys to press to get into a start up mode to even set up the computer####['laptop usability']
i am not blaming the seller , i am blaming mac ' s os and its glitchy services .####['os operation performance', 'support general']
but currently i am happy with it , the battery is ok , and its very aesthetically pleasing .####['laptop design features', 'battery general', 'laptop general']
ordered a macbook pro 13inch 256gb from this seller and with the exception of the power button , the keyboard and the trackpad wasn ' t working .####['hardware general', 'keyboard quality', 'hardware quality', 'laptop general']
the seller ' s description is that it was ` ` tested and fully functional ` ` and it wasn ' t .####['support general']
update : apparently the laptop sold to me was missing 5 screws on the inside that actually holds everything together .####['laptop quality']
while yes , the charger does look great coming out of the box , plan on buying another shortly thereafter - and after , as long as your patience holds up .####['power supply design features']
do not waste your time calling apple to see if there is anything they can do about it after 1 year ( unless of course you want to pay even more money on ' apple care ' ) .####['support general']
as much as i love the computer , and tout macbook to all my friends , for me , it stops here and now .####['laptop general']
the anti - reflective coating will wear off and it isn ' t covered under apple ' s warranty .####['laptop quality', 'warranty general']
the macbook pro offers a very dependable machine that will muddle - through anything you throw at it without complaining .####['laptop operation performance']
2 usb ports and 2 thunderbolt ports on a $ 4500nz laptop ?####['ports general']
the ` ` ssd drive ` ` is not user replaceable .####['hard disc general']
the charger is defective and after 45 days of use the charger is shot .####['power supply quality']
first impressions , excellent looking laptop and very light !####['laptop design features']
i love the keyboard and the trackpad - i finally get it now why both of these have rave reviews .####['keyboard general']
the battery life is good - i get about 5 - 6 hours of non stop typing , with 3 browsers opened and wifi always on .####['battery general']
it ' s not stated anywhere that ' s it ' s used .####['laptop general']
didn ' t purchase from amazon but i can not believe these laptops have 5 stars .####['company general', 'laptop general']
then one day , it stopped booting .####['os operation performance']
my daughter loves it and it will be a great tool to help her through nursing school .####['laptop general']
apparently apple isn ' t even trying anymore .####['company general']
* very good battery life####['battery quality']
it is not worth it .####['laptop general']
i ' m still absolutely blown away how apple , a supposed industry leader , has such horrendous functionality .####['company general']
i purchased this notebook back in july and was initially happy with my purchase .####['laptop general']
after numerous calls , i then received confirmation the warranty was valid , but only as a ‘ one - off ' .####['warranty general']
asus , has a horrible reputation .####['company general']
my final verdict - it ' s somewhat solid as a device now that 6 months of updates and delays are behind us .####['laptop general']
bright enough for all uses , and 1080p is perfect - images are sharp .####['display quality']
- battery life is solid , right around what is claimed - probably 7 to 10 hours depending on variables such as screen brightness and how demanding you ' re being with it .####['battery quality']
- touchscreen is responsive enough for gaming .####['display design features']
i absolutely imagine chrome apps picking up drastically in quality and quantity now , since it seems like chrome os is really coming into its own this year .####['software quality']
- in tablet mode , the screen looks too ‘ tall ' to feel natural ( see the attached picture ) .####['display design features']
this screen ratio makes it look great in desktop mode .####['display design features']
after 3 months of use the unit will no longer charge .####['power supply operation performance']
if it is indeed a software thing and it ' s fixed , i would highly recommend this device .####['laptop general']
second issue is with scaling of the ui .####['software design features']
the screen itself is hd 1080p but most ui elements don ' t look good in this resolution .####['software design features']
unless the app is specifically designed to access google drive files , the app has no way to read and save files directly to the cloud .####['software design features']
• great battery life .####['battery quality']
• volume is incredibly low .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
i would like a quick fix but have not found one that would allow me to consider keeping this beautiful asus chromebook .####['laptop design features']
then i one night i plugged it in and woke up to a dead chromebook .####['laptop general']
it ' s too heavy to really use as a tablet .####['laptop portability']
transfer speeds ( lan to nas ) were miserably slow ( 10 - 30mbps ) .####['ports operation performance']
it was perfect with no backlight bleed , no shimmery matte texture , no uneven backlight , no dead / stuck pixels .####['display general']
this product was fantastic - - great build quality , screen resolution , keyboard - - until one day it stopped turning on .####['laptop operation performance', 'display general', 'laptop general', 'keyboard general', 'laptop quality']
i ' ve been repairing products for years and it was clear this was a power _ supply issue .####['power supply operation performance']
if this device weren ' t nearly $ 500 i might expect it to only last a year , but at this price point it ' s unacceptable .####['laptop quality']
some of the things i wanted to do with this notebook were limited by the os .####['os general']
the laptop was great , lightweight , booted fast , simple to use .####['laptop usability', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
even just this last month it still rates ( on several tech sites ) as one of the best overall chromebook lines to get .####['laptop general']
the asus customer service people are rude and have no answers .####['support quality']
things were fine until the unit stopped charging .####['laptop operation performance', 'power supply operation performance']
this is the problem with companies today .####['company general']
asus customer service sucks .####['support general']
i call customer service , first they argue and say customer damage then to try and placate me they say they have an adp accidental damage and protection plan one time for one year .####['support operation performance']
it is a beautiful , well built laptop .####['laptop design features']
that ' s nutty for an expensive premium product .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop price']
asus what the heck were you thinking when you designed this product ?####['company general']
i seriously love the product but i may have to return it .####['laptop general']
now i only leave it charging until it ' s full but the battery time is still decreasing .####['battery quality']
very impressed with my first chromebook .####['laptop general']
i don ' t use it as much in tablet mode as i thought as it is a little heavy when in that configuration .####['laptop portability']
i had high hopes for this tablet / computer based on customer reviews .####['laptop general']
google docs work fine .####['software operation performance']
a chromebook does most of what i need , except gaiming .####['laptop general']
second , and most annoying , it would not identify my printer in cloud print .####['ports operation performance']
so , guess i ' m screwed , because now after 6 months my tpm is no longer working and the whole computer is useless .####['laptop operation performance', 'hard disc operation performance']
product is sturdy , lightweight , fast , and the battery runtime was as advertised !####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance', 'battery quality']
i had to buy a mouse because the touchpad is very sticky .####['keyboard design features']
not at all pleasant to use also , the screen quality is just so - so .####['display quality', 'laptop general']
and not buy any asus product again####['company general']
the third one is ok but has a dead pixel .####['laptop general']
i ' ve contacted amazon and asus and no response .####['support general']
this piece of crap won ' t hold a wifi signal or has a really weak signal .####['laptop connectivity']
several of my chrome extensions perform poorly and have to be disabled altogether which degrades my work production experience .####['software operation performance']
however , 1 ) the speakers on this thing are horrible .####['multimedia devices general']
battery life is not good .####['battery general']
but screen is very weird .####['display general']
the intel m3 processor is amazing , this thing can do a ton of multi - tasking and the google play store is nice to have , the android apps variants trump the chromebook pre - loaded apps .####['cpu operation performance', 'software general', 'software operation performance']
a great chromebook , but stopped charging in 3 months .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
i was really excited to purchase this product because it was more affordable .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
chromebooks are cool , but they dont last at all .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
hey this machine is extremely useable and functionable .####['laptop usability', 'laptop operation performance']
battery no longer charging .####['battery operation performance']
furthermore , the file system is extremely complicated to use .####['os usability']
the display panel on the machine i received is warped .####['display quality']
half the time it doesn ' t want to turn on and just flashes .####['laptop operation performance']
the machine looks great from the hardware point , but the whole concept of chrome os and cloud applications sucks .####['hardware design features', 'software general', 'os general', 'laptop general']
in the middle of using , it rebooted , then went into an endless boot loop , so i tried to reset it to factory default , now it says chrome os is missing or damaged .####['os operation performance']
the screen hinge feels weak .####['hardware design features']
screen is average by 2017 standards .####['display quality']
the chromebook is brilliant overall .####['laptop general']
google provides zeros customer support related to the os .####['support general']
horrible product .####['laptop general']
tech support is no help unless you are willing to part with your computer for months without guarantee of return .####['support general']
i am having a very difficult time with this chromebook .####['laptop general']
it freezes constantly and needs to be shut off to start again .####['laptop operation performance']
the microphone does not work with regular speaker .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
the tablet mode is horribly integrated with the os and applications .####['software general', 'os general', 'laptop general']
i tried returning the second one bu it does n ' t give me the option to return it .####['support general']
this is nothing more than an okay laptop to get you through basic work activities .####['laptop general']
overall it ' s one of the nicest chrombooks out there .####['laptop general']
however , mine came with an annoying trackpad .####['keyboard general']
the top metal monitor casing seems to be soft and bendable .####['hardware design features']
mine arrived with the metal screen casing slightly bent , i can easily bend it back , not sure about the durability of this thing in the long term .####['display quality']
however , shortly after i received it , a buzzing sound started coming out of the right side usb port .####['ports quality']
so chromebook with some manufacturing issues + bad customer service####['support general', 'laptop general']
they 1080 screen makes the fonts to small for this size screen .####['display design features']
i find the chromium os to be very limiting and would not recommend it over a cheap windows pc .####['laptop price', 'os general']
the keyboard is fantastic , but it ' s just a keyboard .####['keyboard general']
the touchpad is also some strange off color plastic .####['keyboard design features']
1 - faulty trackpad resulting in jerky erratic cursor movement relative to the smooth movement of your finger .####['keyboard operation performance']
i then noticed a dead pixel on the screen .####['display quality']
however , if you want a really speedy chromebook , it ' s great .####['laptop operation performance']
the first unit i received shortly died after a few hours of usage .####['laptop quality']
i like the addition of the cooler boost button , but most of the time i don ' t have to use it because i have a thermaltake auto laptop cooling pad that monitors the bottom surface of my laptop .####['fans&cooling general']
trackpad is ok .####['keyboard general']
wireless card is finicky with both units i had .####['hardware design features']
my laptop seems to lose its internet connection at random times .####['laptop connectivity']
after being on the phone with technical support and windows support for a combined 10 hours , i am told that the hardware is defective and must be replaced .####['hardware quality']
run like heck from this machine .####['laptop operation performance']
it will break , even if it works at first .####['laptop quality']
this laptop isn ' t even 30 days old yet .####['laptop general']
literally just closing it and opening it up later was a 50 / 50 proposition if it would wake up , or the display would crash , or the disk would crash , or some driver would fail - on a brand new laptop .####['software quality', 'laptop quality', 'hard disc quality', 'display quality']
hook up the cat5 and the machine is screaming at high speed and exactly what i was hoping for .####['laptop operation performance']
by the time i was returning it , the system was in such poor shape from the msi .####['os operation performance']
i believe if you happen to uninstall / install the drivers in exactly the correct order and / or do a clean win 10 installation yourself , this laptop should perform well for the price .####['laptop operation performance']
the sound is really terrible and tinny .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
it ' s fast .####['laptop operation performance']
excellent product####['laptop general']
i ' ve always liked msi for their performance and fairly decent price .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop price']
it was actually more like 1h45m and this was also after optimizing the battery .####['battery operation performance']
so , four days after buying this laptop , it stopped booting .####['laptop operation performance']
for the four days i used it , it worked pretty good .####['laptop operation performance']
this laptop is not worth the time and definitely not the money .####['laptop general']
we call tech support together and the guy who answers is just so not interested in helping .####['support operation performance']
i am extremely disappointed with this laptop .####['laptop general']
update : this is by far and away the worst computer i have ever purchased .####['laptop general']
got the second laptop , died within a month and same thing .####['laptop general']
this kept plaguing the laptop as more problems kept piling up including various bsod errors mostly involving the hardware .####['laptop quality', 'hardware quality']
poor design and terrible tech support .####['laptop design features', 'support general']
this computer is amazing !####['laptop general']
quite like this laptop so far , only writing this review so early from owning it to receive that nice msi headset .####['multimedia devices general', 'laptop general']
not too happy with msi , likely to return this laptop .####['company general', 'laptop general']
this laptop was great starting out of the box .####['laptop general']
their support page is very buggy , and the support people are unhelpful .####['support general']
sooooo i would avoid this and i ' m pretty much avoiding the optane drive which may have been part of the issue .####['graphics general']
after this issue i finally decided to return my product .####['laptop general']
good luck this customer tech support and msi has absolutely no idea how to help you .####['support general']
i ' ve had to do a factory reset on this piece of garbage 4 times and i ' ve only owned it for 4 months .####['laptop general']
you can feel the plastic bending if you pick up the laptop with one hand .####['laptop design features']
i really loved this laptop .####['laptop general']
i will never own another msi product .####['laptop general']
now i feel bad buying this for my child , as this laptop seem to have a solid rating elsewhere .####['laptop general']
so i ' m stuck with a 3 month old laptop that does n ' t work .####['laptop general']
eventually got to the point that even when i reinstalled windows it was so slow that there are clearly serious build defects / instabilities on this product .####['laptop quality']
when it is functioning it works great .####['laptop operation performance']
finding out you bought garbage for the steep price of $ 700 + .####['laptop general']
overall a decent laptop if not for these problems , also , the laptop has minor screen freezes even while playing low graphical games like league of legends .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
laptop malfunctioned and stopped working after only 3 months .####['laptop operation performance']
it does have a nice screen that is very bright , decent viewing angle and ok for contrast .####['display general']
the keyboard is very nice and very responsive .####['keyboard operation performance']
i love the fast bootup time with the optane memory , a nice alternative to a very expensive ssd .####['os operation performance', 'memory operation performance']
the charge doesn ' t last like the five hours it stated but instead last three hours .####['power supply operation performance']
had it for a month and it ' s riddled with problems .####['laptop general']
as others have said , the only downside is the slow 5400 rpm 1 tb hard drive .####['hard disc operation performance']
+ very good ips matte fhd panel , zero reflections , almost zero light bleed , average brightness .####['display design features']
used as bought , it is an ok laptop , but not great ( probably a 3 star value ) .####['laptop general']
- no ethernet port ( not that i ' ve used or needed one that i can recall )####['ports design features']
no backlit keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
it has plenty of power for most tasks .####['power supply operation performance']
the only weak point of the laptop is the hard drive it come with , but luckily this laptop is extendable - 2 ram slots and one m .####['laptop design features']
i paid $ 500 for a 15 ` ` notebook with 8gb ram , latest i5 - 8250u cpu with reasonable weight and its quite extendable , i am happy for this deal .####['laptop design features']
also , i ' m not a fan of the delete and power button being next to each other , now i see what the other people are complaining about accidentally shutting it off .####['keyboard design features']
haven ' t had any issues yet so pretty glad i chose this .####['laptop operation performance']
very nice looking laptop for the money .####['laptop design features', 'laptop price']
features windows 10 , sharp display , and card slot for m .####['ports general', 'os general', 'display operation performance']
great quality computer .####['laptop quality']
like the flip , this has good build quality .####['laptop quality', 'laptop general']
so far it has been able to handle everything i ' ve thrown at it .####['laptop operation performance']
all in all , pretty good stuff .####['laptop general']
2 and this laptop is an epic powerhouse for under $ 700 .####['laptop general']
very good laptop if you want something lightweight for everyday browsing .####['laptop design features']
excellent hardware , however i ran into some nasty trouble after updating windows 10 .####['hardware general', 'os general']
so , shortly after buying it i had to format it .####['laptop operation performance']
and just now , the computer says it is plugged in but not charging .####['laptop operation performance']
the fingerprint reader works most of the time .####['hardware operation performance']
the sound is fine for me but not as good as external speakers .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
not that this machine boots up slow .####['laptop operation performance']
great value for a laptop .####['laptop general']
love the 15 inch screen in the body of a 14 inch body .####['display general']
cheaply made plastic but performance is well worth the trade for a $ 500 laptop .####['laptop quality', 'laptop operation performance']
touchpad works well .####['keyboard design features']
the speakers are mediocre and don ' t put out too much volume and are sensitive to position .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
i do like the screen on this , images are clean and crisp , enjoying the 4 gigs of ram which allow me to have a few more tab open .####['display general', 'memory general']
i like how it ' s so simple , without so much clutter and complexity .####['laptop design features']
i ' m still keeping this as a backup or additional laptop because of its cheap price .####['laptop price']
anyways , i really would of liked to have kept the chromebook as it was the perfect weight , size , and design for my upcoming college semester .####['laptop design features']
laptop would never power on , even after being charged for 24 hours .####['power supply general']
i want to love this laptop because it is so lightweight and sleek .####['laptop design features']
it ' s decent .####['laptop general']
ssd hardware issue####['hard disc quality']
note : support for amazon is making it good and immediately sent me the return label , bought through third party but i will get my money back , thank god for amazon customer service####['support quality']
the return procedure is so elaborate that i may decide to just write this purchase up as one big mistake .####['support general']
daughter opened it for christmas and it doesn ' t stay on .####['laptop general']
they keyboard felt responsive and was a good size .####['keyboard design features', 'keyboard operation performance']
i am very close to just returning it and never buying another acer product ever again .####['laptop general']
i will give them props for the build quality .####['laptop quality']
combine these items together and this item became very frustrating .####['laptop general']
- exceptional keyboard and touchpad feel####['hardware operation performance', 'keyboard general']
- below average screen brightness about 200 nits , average is 250 - 275 .####['display design features']
as you can see from the reviews it worked out fine for most people .####['laptop general']
when i sent it back to acer to repair it they simply claimed it had water damaging and couldn ' t fix it .####['support quality']
my acer aspire e 15 worked great for a day , and then shut off by itself .####['laptop general']
by june 2018 , the keyboard stopped working , and i had to do an unplug and reboot .####['keyboard operation performance']
now given that without the issue they are a nice laptop .####['laptop general']
good performance for the price and my intention as the support for my family was to have everyone on these with a spare to deal with ones that break down .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop price']
i purchased this computer because it came highly rated by consumer reports , pc magazine , and other raters .####['laptop general']
the reason why i ' m giving this laptop a two star is because overall i think the quality of it is good especially for the price .####['laptop quality', 'laptop price']
can not remove the battery .####['battery design features']
i too have the black screen problem .####['display operation performance']
computer is fine but the speakers broke after 1 week of use .####['multimedia devices quality', 'laptop general']
the computer is good for the price , but the hdmi port is already broken .####['laptop price', 'ports operation performance']
won ' t turn on , won ' t charge , have to send it to tx to be repaired .####['laptop operation performance']
i want to insist that this is not a game laptop , as many have reviewed it as .####['laptop general']
battery life can last me roughly 5 or 6 hours on internet usage alone with multiple tabs .####['battery operation performance']
the speakers on the bottom take a moment to get used to but after that it ' s alright .####['multimedia devices general']
also , i hate the keyboard - it feels really cheap .####['keyboard general']
overall the laptop is cheap and flimsy .####['laptop price', 'laptop quality']
mx150 gaphics card is also pretty bad .####['graphics general']
and i genuinely believed in acer , but first i had a lot of issues setting up the computer and after hours of customer service help the touch pad did n ' t even work .####['keyboard quality']
i took it to my local computer repair who states it has a bad board .####['motherboard general']
there ' s something wrong with my laptop .####['laptop general']
something is wrong with the power management .####['battery general']
very disappointed in the $ 600 e 15 , as opposed to the no frills , plain old , < $ 200 15 i ' ve had for 2 .####['laptop general']
the trackpad stopped working after four weeks of using it .####['hardware operation performance']
there is a flicker in the middle of the screen that is very annoying .####['display design features']
the computer runs decent but the keypad turns off every time the computer sleeps .####['keyboard design features']
otherwise , so far it is working well .####['laptop operation performance']
i presented my son with a gift of a defective machine .####['laptop general']
the computer itself is actually quite fast with the ssd and processor , so my experience there so far has been good .####['cpu quality', 'laptop operation performance', 'hard disc quality', 'laptop general']
keyboard and track pad shoved way left .####['keyboard operation performance']
keyboard rattles loudly when typing on left side .####['keyboard operation performance']
will not connect to wifi , amd screen flashes when adjusting while on .####['ports connectivity', 'display operation performance']
but the speakers are absolutely horrible !####['multimedia devices operation performance']
latest 8th generation core i5 cpu####['cpu general']
keyboard has flex####['keyboard design features']
no backlight at keyboard####['keyboard design features']
key presses are too stiff to press .####['keyboard usability']
hdd makes this laptop very slow .####['laptop design features', 'hard disc design features']
but asus engineers designed the case and laptop not to be opened by users .####['laptop operation performance']
there is no backlight and keys are too stiff .####['keyboard design features']
i believe it is not healthy to use this keyboard for a long time .####['keyboard miscellaneous']
linux is mostly compatible with this laptop except fingerprint reader .####['hardware general']
video converting process with same video file took only 25 minutes with asus vivobook f510ua .####['laptop operation performance']
3 ) you can hear the screen creak .####['display quality']
it doesn ' t support a hardwire connection .####['laptop connectivity']
i have installed no software on it yet it updates something every day and wants to reboot .####['laptop operation performance']
it just locked up again .####['laptop operation performance']
did i mention it sounds like a lawn mower ?####['hard disc operation performance']
i will say i do enjoy the screen quality , the wifi is fast on this laptop .####['ports operation performance']
in all , stay away .####['laptop general']
- keyboard is comfortable to use####['keyboard usability']
- finger doesn ' t side smoothly along track pad .####['hardware usability']
horrible laptop !####['laptop general']
i had to spend over $ 160 to return it .####['laptop general']
i will never buy an other asus product .####['company general']
it just crashed , dead .####['laptop operation performance']
- the screen looks pretty good , except when viewing anything dark .####['display general']
- the keyboard is awful .####['keyboard general']
when i asked asus for a replacement key , they said i ' d have to ship it back to them , which would have left me without a computer for 2 weeks .####['support general']
don ' t buy it .####['laptop general']
after my 3rd boot up it ' s damaged .####['os operation performance']
after a month of use , disk ( c : ) runs at 100 % all the time .####['hard disc operation performance']
everything else is very good and i am satisfied####['laptop general']
do not buy this computer if your plan is to multitask , play an occasional game and / or play music while searching the web .####['laptop general']
this is first impression , 1st day using it####['laptop general']
overall good laptop .####['laptop general']
the fingerprint scanner is half jotted and barely works .####['hardware operation performance']
one day of use and the screen turns itself off and logs you out whenever it feels to do so .####['display operation performance']
finger print scanner not working whatsoever .####['hardware quality']
with all the great spec hardware in this laptop , why would you put a 5400rpm hard drive in this unit ?####['hardware general', 'hard disc general']
poor touch pad , it get stuck .####['hardware general']
- the physical case is solid and of a production quality you ' d expect in machine 3 - 5x the price of this machine####['laptop quality']
- user interfaces that are tight , responsive####['os operation performance']
all and all , it ' s a light weight , but very robust development stack , that also has the added convenience of cloud9 ' s collaboration features wherein multiple developers can be writing code in even the same file simultaneously .####['os design features', 'os operation performance']
thus far , i ' ve loaded a number of games , my password vault , several productivity apps , skype , spotify and some network scanning android apps and they ' ve all worked very well .####['software operation performance']
mouse and trackpad settings are very minimalist , there ' s no way to modify short - cut keys , and the power management options are pretty minimal , too .####['software design features']
and the google play store is chock - full of great apps and games .####['software design features']
it ' s really seamless and smooth to move back and forth and makes experimenting with different linux configs and environments effortless .####['os operation performance']
