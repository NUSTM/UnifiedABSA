update : i repaired it myself for $ 12 .####['laptop general']
this works fine for that .####['laptop quality']
we ordered this chromebook for my son to use for school .####['laptop general']
when switching between tablet and laptop mode quickly the screen will blink and turn off for an extended period of time before turning back on .####['display operation performance']
it was nice when it was working .####['laptop general']
it feels like a tablet / computer for a child since it ' s so bulky and heavy .####['laptop general']
i really think it ' s junk .####['laptop general']
runs good , poor battery life .####['laptop operation performance', 'battery quality']
i even tried reinstalling the drivers and doing a system restore , nothing would fix it .####['laptop general']
i was so glad that the problem would finally be fixed .####['power supply general']
to my great dismay and disappointment , the power icon read the exact same message : ` ` plugged in , not charging ` ` .####['software operation performance']
i ' ve only found 2 other recent reviews of this product that had the same problem ( go ahead and search for them in the reviews ) .####['laptop quality']
the built - in speaker is below average .####['multimedia devices general']
im returning it .####['laptop general']
feel like at max brightness it just isn ' t enough .####['display operation performance']
no backlit keyboard is kinda a bummer but i digress .####['keyboard design features']
i went with the asus vivobook based on the good specs , better hdd and ram , reviews , and because i could pay for it over several months .####['hardware general', 'laptop price', 'laptop design features', 'memory general']
edit : reinstalled the driver now the audio is better on earphones .####['multimedia devices general']
with ssd lightning fast start up####['memory operation performance']
no back light keyboard####['keyboard design features']
performance is mediocre####['laptop operation performance']
i like the laptop for it ' s hardware , and it ' s working properly .####['hardware general', 'laptop operation performance']
the actual laptop is very much darker and blue .####['laptop design features']
the new computer failed again with the same error .####['laptop quality']
the computer constantly pauses or stutters and then continues when it comes to loading web pages and working on documents .####['laptop quality']
not happy with this one .####['laptop general']
the computer worked well for a few weeks , then the screen backlight died .####['display operation performance', 'laptop general']
will never buy an asus product again .####['laptop general']
no backlighting on the keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
the fan blows like crazy and it makes so much noise .####['fans&cooling operation performance']
i would not recommend you buying this laptop , the specs are fine for the price , but the hardware is rubbish .####['hardware general', 'laptop price', 'laptop general']
all around , a very lacking laptop .####['laptop general']
this computer arrived fine but will not charge .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
how can a brand new computer not charge properly ?####['laptop operation performance']
i received this laptop promptly .####['shipping general']
i could n ' t have put my feelings about my new acer aspire e 15 e5 - 576g - 5762 better .####['laptop general']
overall impression : this is a killer laptop for a killer deal !####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
: p ) , and the machine is definitely zippy .####['laptop operation performance']
oh , and the nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least ( grid autosport fps avg is in the 80s / 90s or so )####['graphics operation performance']
+ great and fast cpu and overall fast pc performance####['laptop operation performance', 'cpu operation performance']
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####['display design features', 'laptop price']
this laptop is the best for the price in my opinion .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
i have been beyond pleased with this laptop purchase over the last 6 months of use .####['laptop general']
it is also amazingly quiet : the ssd doesn ' t make any noise , and the fan only spins up if i am doing something intensive like playing games or running a heafty program - just browsing or watching videos / basic office work will not make this computer more than whisper .####['hardware operation performance']
additionally , this has a nice backlight to the keyboard , which will turn off when nothing has been pressed for about 20 seconds ( great for when just watching or reading something ) or can be manually turned off entirely .####['keyboard usability']
in addition , you are gifted with an sd card reader and an optical drive which can read and write cds and dvds ( which i can ' t say i ' ve used other than testing that it worked , but i do remember how hazardous it is to suddenly need something like that and not have it available ) .####['optical drives operation performance']
- the keys , often described as mushy , still have a decent click and distance to them .####['keyboard design features']
- i swear my screen periodically changes brightness but i can ' t tell if this is my imagination or not .####['display operation performance']
- windows 10 ( do i really need to list the drawbacks of 10 ?####['os operation performance']
great laptop for expansion and upgrade .####['laptop design features']
screen is bright , doesn ' t feel heavy .####['display design features']
the screen looks good despite some other reviews .####['display general']
after running good for the initial 25 first days it won ' t power on .####['laptop operation performance']
i still find the one piece touch pads unreliable to use even after all the tweaking .####['hardware operation performance']
my first time with a solid state drive , very nice quick and quiet .####['hard disc operation performance']
i will painfully learn the new pads .####['hardware usability']
the screen is more than sufficient for non - gaming , business use , and it seems as fast as expected .####['display operation performance']
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####['hard disc design features']
to get the features like this good luck .####['laptop general']
i have the intel core i7 , soooo fast !####['cpu operation performance']
love the cortana !####['software general']
was very easy to add memory .####['laptop usability']
the acer is similar but bigger and heavier .####['laptop design features']
i have been using a chromebook now for three years and am totally satisfied .####['laptop general']
chromebooks are light weight and start up immediately and are very easy to use .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features', 'laptop usability']
i love this chromebook !####['laptop general']
occasionally it will get sort of slow and then i ' ll go to settings and clear the image cache and that takes care of it .####['laptop operation performance']
the keyboard is nice .####['keyboard general']
first time chrome os user , very streamlined and easy to use .####['os usability']
i can carry both of them in a reasonably sized purse and not hurt my shoulder .####['laptop portability']
if you ' re going to be doing a lot of heavy lifting , this might not be the chromebook for you .####['laptop operation performance']
i ' m travelling overseas with it , and it goes everywhere i do and does everything i do - except i can no longer multitask and annoy my mother in video calls !####['laptop usability']
i * love * it !####['laptop general']
it ' s lightweight .####['laptop design features']
fast shipping too !####['shipping quality']
i ' m using this device to run a small etsy business and its perfect for my needs .####['laptop operation performance']
it is a good product at an affordable price .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
this chromebook was one of the best gift to my grandauther .####['laptop general']
it arrived as promised and was exactly as described .####['shipping quality']
one of my favorite things i own####['laptop general']
if you do n ' t need a full blown laptop this is a good choice .####['laptop general']
i was very surprised at how fast it came .####['shipping operation performance']
i am very happy with this purchase .####['laptop general']
the battery seriously lasts as long as i need it , and i ' m one to forget to charge it .####['battery operation performance']
not as much i can do on it , but it is adequate .####['laptop general']
which , to be sure , is great , i had just hoped for something slightly more agile .####['laptop general']
google docs are getting so good and user friendly who needs office anymore , content accessible anywhere , just takes a little time to get used to but once you realize all the benefits chromebook is a great choice .####['laptop quality', 'software operation performance']
every additional feature would be unnecessary for my personal usage .####['laptop design features']
the battery will last a full day or two so it ' s very good for a middle school student .####['battery operation performance']
such a perfect little computer .####['laptop general']
battery life is excellent and our students love them !####['battery general']

has all the top features and runs fast .####['laptop operation performance']
solid chromebook .####['laptop quality']
i like the ease of connecting to the internet wi - fi .####['laptop connectivity']
i woudlnt recommend more than 10 active tabs which slows down some of the functionality but otherwise runs smoothly for students####['laptop operation performance']
this item is excellent and not bad for the price .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
works well for writing novels which is what i bought it for .####['laptop operation performance']
surprisingly fast for such a small chrome book .####['laptop operation performance']
another thing , it is much thinner than expected .####['laptop design features']
it ' s a solid and quality built laptop .####['laptop quality']
nice keyboard####['keyboard general']
i ' m giving this five stars considering the price .####['laptop price']
decent laptop for home use .####['laptop general']

( not amazing graphics at those settings )####['graphics operation performance']
solid inexpensive computer for our 10 year old####['laptop design features', 'laptop price']

it ' s exactly as i wanted it####['laptop general']
i would definitely recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking for a cheap and nice computer .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
if you need a decent computer that runs quality this is it , especially if you are starting out .####['laptop general']
fast delivery , thanks to amazon .####['company general', 'shipping operation performance']
pros : nice size , clear screen , quick on start up , very functional and easy to use .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features', 'laptop usability', 'display general']
it ' s also very lightweight , so it ' s easy to carry around .####['laptop design features', 'laptop portability']
also audio is pretty decent .####['multimedia devices general']
but if you keep it plugged in it ' s great !####['laptop operation performance']
it works like it is made to run linux .####['laptop operation performance']
love this laptop####['laptop general']
great computer .####['laptop general']
that said if you ' re not a computer savvy no worries as soon as you turn it on cortana the computers assistant walks you through everything that you need to do .####['os general']
this is a brand i look for that i feel i can trust .####['company general']
nice little computer for the price .####['laptop price']
i wish the camera was a little better , but it ' s great otherwise .####['multimedia devices general', 'laptop general']
it ' s not real fast and it doesn ' t have a lot of storage .####['laptop operation performance', 'hard disc general']
i don ' t ask much of a laptop so i am happy with it .####['laptop general']
it ' s fast , connects quickly to wifi , and the screen is quite nice .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop connectivity', 'display general']
the only problem that i have found about lenovo is that it comes with a program called migration , which is supposed to migrate your things from your old computer to your new computer .####['software design features']
no problems with this computer .####['laptop general']
fast to start up .####['laptop operation performance']
if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .####['laptop general']
runs great - however , i just tried to upload my small adventure videos and the built in video player stops mid video about 10 seconds in - audio continues .####['laptop operation performance', 'multimedia devices operation performance']
i have yet to update the drives on it or try a game but so far its a good machine .####['laptop general']
i recommend buying it .####['laptop general']
very good purchase .####['laptop general']
the price was great during prime days .####['laptop price']
price and product , outstanding .####['laptop price']
it look like a professional laptop but overrall get this laptop you wo n ' t regret it , no negativity about it####['laptop general']
works well .####['laptop operation performance']
this device ( and its brother the plus ) has a grave hardware flaw that causes the touchscreen to move on its own .####['display operation performance', 'hardware operation performance']
ridiculous for something so expensive , some internet research shows numerous people having this issue .####['laptop price']
now there are pixels on the screen not working , and they are multiplying .####['display quality']
the pixels are currently stuck .####['display operation performance']
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .####['display operation performance']
no matter where on earth , you can get your apple product repaired .####['support general']
i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of keyboards and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .####['keyboard general']
it does indeed look excellent !####['display design features']
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####['laptop operation performance']
there is a power button on the side which i have accidentally hit quite a few times .####['keyboard design features']
except , you know , when it decided to become unusable .####['laptop operation performance']
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####['keyboard general', 'laptop design features']
you know , i wanted to love this machine .####['laptop general']
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .####['keyboard operation performance']
the problem is that it never charged .####['laptop operation performance']
the cable functions just fine .####['power supply operation performance']
reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .####['display operation performance', 'laptop quality']
no caps lock on the keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
samsung sent me a new stylus free of charge and free of hassle , which was nice of them because the top of the oem stylus popped off one day and could not be reassembled .####['hardware general']
i keep it at about 60 - 70 % and it looks fantastic .####['display operation performance']
bought this for someone else , can ' t believe how good it is .####['laptop general']
it take a bit of getting used to .####['keyboard usability']
as other reviews have mentioned - its a bit heavier than expected for such a slim frame .####['laptop design features']
it ' s great in many ways ; the build is solid , the screen is good ( and the resolution is insane ) , and the keyboard is decent , though only time will tell if it ' s as diet coke - resistant as the samsung ' s keys are .####['display design features', 'display general', 'laptop quality', 'keyboard design features', 'laptop general']
more importantly i appreciate the uncanny speed to boot up or wake up .####['os operation performance']
never has it run out of power while on battery .####['battery operation performance']
the 1080p display is very sharp .####['display operation performance']
great device for browsing the internet .####['laptop miscellaneous']
hulu app is not supported for this computer so you will need to use the browser .####['laptop design features']
i love how slim the design is - will fit easily into my backpack : ) highly recommend for everyday or school use !####['laptop design features', 'laptop general']
the chrome rdp app also works well , connecting to my windows machines with good performance , and i can access files on my nas using network file shares after using the chromebook for the last couple of weeks , i ' d confidently recommend one for everything but gaming and special purpose applications .####['laptop miscellaneous', 'software operation performance']
battery life is excellent , and i can get several days use before needing to plug in .####['battery operation performance']
with chrome remote desktop i am able to play turn - based video games such as hearthstone or civ 5 while miles away from the computer actually running them .####['software usability']
you can ' t use it to edit a word document .####['os usability']
very easy to set up and light to carry .####['laptop usability', 'laptop portability']
we actually returned the first acer chromebook 14 , we got because the screen would blink randomly and go off .####['display quality']
guaranteed excellent customer service !####['support general']
first of all , this is a physically beautiful machine .####['laptop design features']
in summary , it looks great and performs very well .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
i purchased this item 7 months ago and i love it .####['laptop general']
i purchased this chromebook strictly for writing / editing ( i ' m an independent and published author ) and web browsing .####['laptop usability']
losing the function keys for a toucher was a deal breaker .####['keyboard design features']
i run windows and linux vms fairly regularly and while i could run them on a comparable windows system , adding windows systems to an already portly windows system has never worked out well for me , so while disappointed in the new upgrades , this 2015 model still rocks vms and does all i need it too for far less $ $ $ .####['software usability']
when the computer is working hard , it doesn ' t burn my lap anymore ( although i do feel some hot air flowing through my fingertips , when i am typing , but i am okay with that ) .####['fans&cooling general']
i don ' t like this .####['ports general']
the keyboard is ok .####['keyboard general']
it ' s nice and lightweight , the sd port is useful , and it ' s powerful enough for me to do fairly layer intensive graphic design work in photoshop and basic grading in lightroom .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features', 'ports usability', 'laptop general']
the keys feel fantastic to type on .####['keyboard operation performance']
the display is excellent !####['display general']
i was due to upgrade and this product seemed perfect for me .####['laptop general']
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####['software general', 'software operation performance']
adobe apps are also power hogs , but that is to be expected .####['software operation performance']
it works great !####['laptop operation performance']
as far as gaming performance , the m370x does quite well .####['graphics operation performance']
i ventured back to the macbook pro world and purchased this model after much research .####['laptop general']
all - in - all , i have been extremely satisfied so far with this purchase and am enjoying my not - so - cutting edge purchase .####['laptop general']
but the mac looked and worked great .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
laptop in perfect condition .####['laptop general']
laptop is as described .####['laptop general']
it didn ' t come with the box but it came with the charger and so far , i ' ve only been using for a few days , but i have no issues with the item at all .####['laptop operation performance']
i always was a huge fan of apple and i always thought the price on the macbook pros were too steep but i finally took the plunge and i ' m satisfied .####['laptop price']
it came exactly as advertised .####['laptop general']
the display is amazing and the new force click trackpad is an awesome addition .####['keyboard general', 'display operation performance']
as a refurbished item it was indistinguishable from a new item .####['laptop general']
i love this computer .####['laptop general']
slim , very fast , great screen , lightweight , solid state drives , great battery ( even though it burns the battery life when i play my flight simulator due to processing demands of the graphics ! )####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features', 'battery operation performance', 'display general']
the pro is by far the best .####['laptop general']
the retina screen does an excellent job of not tiring my eyes after a long day of computer work .####['display operation performance']
i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !####['laptop general']
1 - itunes match ( $ 25 / yr i believe ) keeps all of your music synced across all of your ios devices with no limit .####['software general']
january 21 , 2016 update : i love this laptop even more than before .####['laptop general']
i ' ve only had it for one day and the set up was easy , and all items delivered were present , will update over time !####['os usability']
overall , i ' m very happy i chose this model .####['laptop general']
the display clarity is outstanding .####['display operation performance']
it is a great laptop !####['laptop general']
one year later and the laptop is still in great condition !####['laptop operation performance']
the macbook pro is everything i hoped for and more .####['laptop general']
small light portable , excellent screen , very fast performance and soo quiet , does this have a fan ?####['laptop operation performance', 'display general']
fast delivery , brand new as expected .####['shipping quality']
very nicely packed in original box .####['shipping general']
computer came in good condition and at a good price .####['shipping price', 'shipping general']
works great !####['laptop operation performance']
the retina display is stunning .####['display general']
i bought this chromebook on the prime day deal , but even without $ 60 off it would still have been worth the money .####['laptop price']
my only complaint is the click on the touchpad feels a little cheap , but i just use ` ` tap to click ` ` so it ' s not an issue .####['hardware operation performance']
when i recieved the item i was amazed at the quality of it .####['laptop quality']
nothing on it feels cheap at all .####['laptop design features']
i boot it up and notice quickly the display seems to be 720p ( or something close ) but for what i need this thing to do .####['display operation performance']
i use some other apps but nothing is quite the same for my workflow .####['software design features']
i thought the gizmo was neat but i was disappointed that i couldn ' t really use it the way i wanted to it that regards .####['laptop operation performance']
i could even watch videos and game from the laptop itself ( to an extent ) .####['laptop usability']
that is just incredible .####['laptop general']
i chose this one mainly because of the full size keyboard , larger screen , and full size hdmi .####['display design features', 'keyboard design features', 'ports design features']
yes , this chromebook comes with the android app store pre - installed .####['laptop design features']
although 4 gigs of ram doesn ' t seem like a lot to some of us , because of the simple software , it is very fast with no lag .####['software design features', 'laptop operation performance', 'memory quality']
the power button is no longer on the keyboard , but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine .####['laptop design features']
in preparation for becoming a chromebook user i had purchased a 256 gig memory card and moved all my laptop files to it .####['memory general']
every app i have downloaded from the google app store has worked perfectly .####['software operation performance']
of course , i have only had this acer for a week .####['laptop general']
i fixed it , however it took intensive research to fix it .####['laptop general']
as it turned out the thunderbolt ports are of no use .####['ports usability']
the machine looks amazing doesn ' t it !####['laptop general']
apple should ashamed to be associated with this cheap , lousy , clearly inferior , plastic nightmare - but then again , maybe that is exactly what they do want , so profits soar .####['laptop price', 'company general', 'laptop general']
i ' m pretty sure i ordered the biggest size , and i got the smaller one , but whatever it shipped fast and it works great .####['laptop operation performance', 'shipping general']
have not heard any complaints about the product .####['laptop general']
- for such a premium price , this is definitely the worst purchase quality wise that i have made .####['laptop price', 'laptop quality']
your new retina screen will get stains on it from the top layer seperating and or dead pixels .####['display quality']
had it for a week now and still finding things it can not do .####['laptop operation performance']
i originally purchased this at the beginning of april after about a week it stopped charging ( would receive ` ` low power charger ` ` connected message and not charge ) .####['power supply operation performance']
but this asus , who offered so much & rated over 4 stars , turned to a black screen , just over a month after i received it .####['laptop operation performance']
lo and behold , i hadn ' t read quite all of the 1 * reviews : the worst was a teacher who had ordered so many for her several classes and said ` ` i think the problem is with the motherboard .####['motherboard quality']
we ' ve got android nougat on beta running pretty well now .####['os operation performance']
the stock video player misses audio on a lot of movies , and using the vlc app ( android ) is super buggy ( frequently freezes and shuts down ) .####['software operation performance']
the c302 is clean and feels solid .####['laptop design features']
this is a nice perk to save battery life and for folks who like to read / / browse late at night in bed and do n ' t want the backlighting on .####['keyboard design features']
this is now my fastest - charging device .####['laptop operation performance']
i tired every remedy found online , and even got in touch with asus tech support who just said ` ` send it back ` ` .####['support general']
and apparently amazon is experiencing a supply shortage because my replacement isn ' t expected until sometime between jan 11th to feb 5th !####['support general']
i loved this chromebook , it worked great for six months .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
now the romance is over ; it won ' t charge , and my only option is to send it in for service , a 10 - day event not including shipping there and back .####['power supply operation performance']
overall i like the portability and battery life on this device .####['battery quality', 'laptop portability']
google ' s own services like google docs , drive , and gmail don ' t respond well to touch screen gestures often leaving me in despair .####['software design features']
• occasionally hangs for 10 - 30 seconds with no response from keyboard or trackpad####['keyboard operation performance']
i also decided that despite the advantages of the asus , i can not live with the sharp edges and middling volume .####['laptop design features', 'laptop general']
aluminum outer body , usb c charging from either side of the chrombooke , backit keyboard , nice screen resolution and fast processor .####['cpu operation performance']
then about 3 months in , it quit charging from the supplied fast charger .####['power supply operation performance']
i can plug it in and put it back to sleep and it will charge , but if i haven ' t woken it up it won ' t begin to charge .####['laptop operation performance']
as of the time of writing , the audio drivers are still not working , but i typically don ' t care for that anyways .####['software operation performance']
the main bad for this particular variant is that google is no longer going to support it with updates .####['support general']
so be forwarded , if you buy this , you are jumping right into a machine that won ' t get updates anymore ( which is something most chromebook owners want and a feature that makes them better than android and it ' s fragmented market ) .####['laptop general']
but today i noticed it ' s cracking ( ref : pics ) .####['laptop operation performance']
it is the nicest chrome computer i have ever owned .####['laptop general']
after about 60 days use the power adapter / charger stopped working .####['power supply operation performance']
- battery sucks .####['battery operation performance']
build quality is excellent ( was .####['laptop design features']
the space bar on the keyboard is inconsistent .####['keyboard quality']
my main gripe is incompatibility with amazon prime videos and gogo .####['software usability']
i have had the computer for four months , and my computer suddenly wo n ' t turn .####['laptop operation performance']
so i call asus customer support , and received some of the worst customer service ever .####['support general']
it was terrible .####['laptop general']
it surfs the internet fast .####['laptop connectivity']
the key board and mouse pad are not very sensitive .####['keyboard quality']
don ' t let them scam you .####['support general']
cursor won ' t move and touchscreen won ' t work and from reading about this online i am not alone with this issue .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance']
extremely disappointed as this was a gift to my husband .####['laptop general']
this is a great machine in many ways - - and with crouton could run full ubuntu , which made it a great little machine to write code on and deploy to a server .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
nice screen , nice feel .####['display quality']
not super confident this asus unit will last half that long .####['laptop general']
chromebook is 2 months old and charger stopped working .####['power supply operation performance']
this is exactly what i needed in a laptop .####['laptop general']
i still love the laptop , i ' m just a bit disappointed by this and i hope it ' s the only issue i see .####['laptop general']
the battery is far below what i expected .####['battery quality']
moreover i ' m quite upset because it seems amazon will not pay me back the shipping fees , which for me amount to about 100 $ as i live in france .####['shipping general']
i much suspect that google ' s half baked sustem is at fault .####['os general']
10 months in my battery will no longer charge .####['battery operation performance']
the first week i had my chromebook it locked up .####['laptop operation performance']
this product is built well , but it won ' t run the one android app i hoped it would run , and for whatever reason the app and os update download speeds are abysmal .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
and the screen was changing like creazy .####['display operation performance']
i loved this chromebook but i had to return it bevause it had sound issues .####['multimedia devices operation performance', 'laptop general']
after seven months , the usb - c ports stopped charging .####['ports operation performance']
now the hole thing crashed out of nowhere and i ' m going to lose everything i had on it .####['laptop operation performance']
the screen is nice .####['display general']
but after three charge cycles the screen started vibrating vigorously from side - to - side .####['display operation performance']
the tablet is good also , however can ' t they design something that covers the keyboard during tablet mode .####['os design features']
manufacturing seems unreliable .####['laptop quality']
very touchy touch screen , too sensitive .####['display operation performance']
udpate : after talking to tech support , i found out that they made the wrong repair .####['support operation performance']
the screen is great and the unit is fast .####['laptop operation performance', 'display general']
everything was good for a few days after receiving the product .####['laptop general']
