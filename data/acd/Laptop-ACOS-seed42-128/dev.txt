this unit is ` ` pretty ` ` and stylish , so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason .####['laptop design features']
for now i ' m okay with upping the experience & device to 3 out of 5 stars .####['laptop general']
seems unlikely but whatever , i ' ll go with it .####['laptop general']
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####['hardware general']
should not of bought this chromebook .####['laptop general']
after some use , the battery charge had logically gone down some ( down to about 80 % ) , and so i went back to my office to plug it in .####['battery operation performance']
the screen is very dim however .####['display operation performance']
don ' t buy this machine .####['laptop general']
external speakers were decent sounding until right one gave away and now is heavily distorted at even mid vol .####['multimedia devices general']
screen is good .####['display general']
keyboard is decent with good travel .####['keyboard portability']
thin bezels allow for a compact frame####['laptop design features']
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####['company general', 'laptop general']
bought this on may , barely used it and now 4 months later it ' s randomly shutting down every few minutes .####['laptop general']
this computer is loud !####['laptop design features']
i do not think i will need to upgrade the ram .####['memory general']
+ backlight kb and travel feels pretty nice on the keys .####['keyboard operation performance']
i ' ve been happy being able to plug in and run overwatch from time to time on this laptop , with higher settings .####['laptop design features']
the picture clarity is amazing and the backlit keyboard is awesome .####['display quality', 'keyboard design features']
- the battery life is excellent ( i get 6 - 8 hours of normal university student usage out of it ) and even when i ' m using it , it charges as fast as my phone .####['battery operation performance']

very easy to set up .####['laptop usability']
the chromebook was packaged well and we saw no defects ( ours was used ) .####['shipping quality']
it is a basic little laptop and i love it .####['laptop general']
there is a lot of ' bang for your buck ' in the lenovo ideapad 320 .####['laptop general']
my only fair complaint is that it occasionally restarts itself without warning ( usually no more than once every day or two ) .####['laptop operation performance']
love this so much !####['laptop general']
at a ` ` black friday ` ` price , this computers specs could not be beat for the value to dollar performance ratio .####['laptop price']
my only complaint is that the mouse keypad is a little big .####['mouse design features']
i have n ' t used it much for gaming but i imagine it works fine .####['laptop operation performance']
i will never use another microsoft program as long as i live .####['software general']

it is very good for the price .####['laptop price']
google is expecting to add that in sometime in the next year .####['company general']
thankfully , this time , acer has gotten that part right .####['company general']
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####['laptop quality', 'display general', 'laptop operation performance']
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####['laptop price']
i was pleasantly surprised at how good it is .####['laptop general']
- new ports that were not in the 2011 model : hdmi port , extra thunderbolt video port ( now it has two instead of one )####['ports general']
honestly , i think nobody uses these ports anyway .####['ports general']
maybe that ' s a consequence of how the retina display is built , but yeah , it ' s harder to keep the screen clean .####['display general']
i am extremely happy with this laptop .####['laptop general']
the new touchpad takes a little getting used to , but otherwise it ' s been perfect .####['laptop general', 'keyboard general']
however , i have to remove one star for the very unreliable magnetic charging connector .####['power supply design features']
as i bought 13 inch model , it is very portable .####['laptop portability']
i ' ve been extremely impressed by this device .####['laptop general']
the only drawback is that it only comes with 32 gb of hard drive .####['hard disc design features']
configuring the printer was a little tricky but not bad .####['multimedia devices operation performance']

i have not had any freezing or screen flashing issues .####['display operation performance']
did i mention , i can access all my word , excel , and powerpoint files using the google apps .####['software usability']
unfortunately , this particular computer is 100 % unusable after only 2 years and 2 weeks .####['laptop usability']
it is a timeless design and a very respectable screen .####['display general', 'laptop design features']
i ' m disappointed with macbook pro 15 ” because sometimes charger macbook pro 15 ” running overheating !####['power supply operation performance', 'laptop general']

* extremely weak graphics card .####['graphics operation performance']
the intel iris sucks .####['hard disc operation performance']
sometimes they felt a bit half - baked , but i loved the idea , and the keyboard made a world of difference in what you could do with that tablet .####['laptop general', 'keyboard general']
anyhow , within a week , the speakers started crackling annoyingly when watching videos , or playing games .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
unlike other asus laptops i ' ve tried , this unit won the display roulette .####['laptop design features']
the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####['software operation performance']
if i had it to do over , i would not purchase this computer .####['laptop general']
if bluetooth devices worked with this chromebook it would get 5 stars , but this is the least reliable device in regards to bluetooth i have ever owned .####['laptop general']
i feel like i bought a decent machine but it ' s unable to handle the ram workload .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
don ' t get me wrong , the device flips back and forth very well .####['laptop design features']
to say i ' m disappointed in this chromebook would be an understatement .####['laptop general']
this computer is really hard to use .####['laptop usability']
it ' s their policy to only repair not replace .####['support quality']
+ comfortable keyboard####['keyboard design features']
decent enough build , but the mouse pad is terrible .####['laptop design features', 'keyboard general']
games / video apps perform absolutely awfully .####['software operation performance']
the machine ' s visible design itself was fine .####['laptop design features']
the mouse pad is very touchy , but i use a separate bluetooth mouse anyways .####['hardware operation performance']
monitor screen is ok , sometimes the contrast is poor but looks better in games .####['display operation performance']
the laptop now does n ' t even function without needing a full factory reset every 3 hours .####['laptop operation performance']

the laptop was shipped in what looked like a new case but upon opening it , it appeared used and repackaged .####['shipping quality']
every few weeks the system locks up and freezes .####['os operation performance']
before the review this package has nice presentation and solid build .####['laptop quality', 'laptop design features']
adequate screen .####['display general']
i ' ve only had the computer for a little over a month , that is annoying on many levels .####['laptop general']
the manufacturer was not helpful in trying to resolve this issue .####['support general']

unfortunately i was never able to complete this task , because after booting the laptop it suddenly shut - off on me and wouldn ' t turn back on again .####['laptop operation performance']
the wall power adapter charger is not working and then later caught fire .####['power supply operation performance']
