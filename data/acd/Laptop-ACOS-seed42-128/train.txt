overall , it is not horrible , but i wouldn ' t purchase this model again .####['laptop general']
- screen feels smaller than other of the same size .####['display design features']
it also refuses to charge past 90 % and instantly jumps to 80 % when i unplug it .####['laptop operation performance']

the computer constantly pauses or stutters and then continues when it comes to loading web pages and working on documents .####['laptop quality']
should ' ve stick with my pixelbook which was awesome and never have me trouble .####['laptop general']
i would not recommend you buying this laptop , the specs are fine for the price , but the hardware is rubbish .####['hardware general', 'laptop price', 'laptop general']
thanks to its ssd , it boots windows 10 pretty fast , bloatware is kept to a minimum ( please uninstall norton before doing anything else .####['os operation performance']
- trackpad is too finicky and not my favorite####['hardware usability']
as of now , for $ 600 or less , this is a nice buy .####['laptop price']
best pc bang for this level of buck .####['laptop general']
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####['hard disc design features']
the screen looks great ( though maybe not if all you do is look at 4k resolution ) and the keyboard response feels pretty good .####['display design features', 'keyboard operation performance']
for the price , it ' s a solid laptop .####['laptop price']
first time chrome os user , very streamlined and easy to use .####['os usability']
great price - i always buy the warranty .####['warranty general', 'laptop price']
it ' s fast and very easy to use if you are familiar with google drive .####['laptop usability']
this chromebook was one of the best gift to my grandauther .####['laptop general']
one of my favorite things i own####['laptop general']
so far no problems except i tried to print something from my email and am having trouble linking to my printer .####['laptop connectivity']
this is a great notebook .####['laptop general']
package arrived faster than the estimated arrival .####['shipping operation performance']
i woudlnt recommend more than 10 active tabs which slows down some of the functionality but otherwise runs smoothly for students####['laptop operation performance']
choose this one .####['laptop general']
the computer has a solid processor and enough memory to handle pretty much anything the average user willl throw at it , short of graphics - heavy gaming .####['memory quality']
beautiful resolution####['display general']
you just have to deal with a low battery and that ' s all####['battery operation performance']
it was easy to set up .####['laptop usability']
so before you get angry do your homework on why the laptop may be acting strange .####['laptop general']
also can not just ` ` add ` ` memory ddms : only one socket means you must remove the 8gb and purchace a 16gb ( ~ $ 180 further investment ) ; battery not gon na last several hrs , looking at ~ 2 - 4 .####['battery operation performance', 'memory general']
the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####['os operation performance']
the only draw back with this pc is the battery life which lasts about 3 hrs before needing to be charged .####['battery operation performance']
if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .####['laptop general']
i like the size but dislike the battery life .####['battery general', 'laptop design features']
i will see if samsung honors their warrnty , if so , i will probably change / update this review .####['company general']
returning it into a standard laptop position did not help , the screen actually turned dark and only closing and opening the lid helped return it to normal state .####['display operation performance']
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####['laptop operation performance']
awesome display .####['display general']
mouse track pad is non standard .####['hardware operation performance']
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####['laptop price']
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####['hardware operation performance']
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .####['display general']
certain apps ( especially flash based apps ) will get the machine very hot .####['software operation performance']
the keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice .####['keyboard general']
bought this for someone else , can ' t believe how good it is .####['laptop general']
the keys on the keyboard are sunk in a little too low to accommodate for the sleek / thin profile .####['keyboard design features']
overall , the way i see it , i ' m getting a big screen hd android galaxy tablet with a keyboard for the price of a tablet .####['laptop price']
while usb - c is cool , a bag full of dongles is not .####['ports general']
that is awesome .####['hard disc general']
regardless to the fact that the outside box was damaged , the inside box was fine .####['shipping general']
i have used it for business and school and wouldn ' t want any other computer for the job .####['laptop general']
mac really knows how to build a good dev laptop####['company general']

this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####['laptop quality', 'laptop general']
i ' ve had mine 10 months and the motherboard has crapped out twice already .####['motherboard operation performance']
it just is missing a lot of other features that i wanted in a notebook####['laptop design features']
vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####['software operation performance']
i bought this as a gift and was incredibly disappointed as it did n ' t even turn on after the initial charging .####['laptop general']
this is not an inexpensive product , especially for a chrome book but , i figured you get what you pay for .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
after about 60 days use the power adapter / charger stopped working .####['power supply operation performance']
the computer is great , but the charger is garbage .####['power supply general', 'laptop general']
android ` ` the computer will recognize your cellphone ` ` system never works .####['software operation performance']
sadly after barely a year old it crashes all the time , the touch screen rarely works , and the track pad stops working until a reboot on occasion .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance']
i will never buy another asus after this experience .####['laptop general']
today , it stopped powering on .####['power supply operation performance']
i love the way it looks and feels the only thing i can complain about is the fact that none of these electronics come with printed manuels anymore also dont know anything about the camera only see me .####['multimedia devices usability', 'laptop design features']
the chromebook seems to be working fine now and my daughter does love it .####['laptop general']

i ' ve never had a computer as fast as this .####['laptop operation performance']
it took hours to restore to factory default settings , and it crashed once again days later .####['laptop operation performance']
it ' s a very fast laptop .####['laptop operation performance']

very good looking and fast laptop if only if it would stop crashing and having to reset back to default settings .####['laptop quality', 'laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
i absolutely love this laptop , it looks great , its quality is amazing and can handle so many games without any lag involved .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance', 'laptop general', 'laptop quality']

acer support is awful .####['support quality']
very low quality build and quality support .####['laptop quality', 'support quality']
this unit is a great compromise between powerful cpu and gpu with good battery life .####['laptop general', 'battery general', 'cpu operation performance', 'graphics operation performance']
the screen sits too close to the keyboard and you will end up with scratches on the screen .####['keyboard design features']
the laptop itself seemed fine at first .####['laptop general']
i hate to knock acer as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new product and then not being able to turn it on to use it .####['company general', 'laptop general']
usb ports are too hard to plug and unplug####['ports usability']
everything is plastic .####['laptop design features']
the hard drive sounds like a distant lawn mower .####['hard disc operation performance']
- the hard drive is really slow and really loud .####['hard disc operation performance']
one place that i find lacking in chromeos is the settings management .####['os design features']
while the stock aluminum case is darn solid enough , it can take scratches easily from things like keys or cable connectors tossed in a bag with it .####['laptop quality']
this laptop performs in every way .####['laptop operation performance']
- the touchscreen is very responsive , fast , and so far everything has scaled just fine during use####['hardware operation performance']
the design and style is topnotch .####['laptop design features']
the batrey charges very quickly , you will need 1 hour for a full charge .####['power supply operation performance']
it worked beautifully and smoothly .####['laptop operation performance']

chrome has come a long way to be sure and in its optimized avatar on this system its very snappy .####['software operation performance']
the good news is that the android features ( google play store apps ) work nearly across the board .####['software operation performance']
it served my needs of web browsing and word processing for a number of years , but its battery life had dwindled and neither the screen nor the processor can match this asus .####['display general', 'battery general', 'cpu general']
i absolutely love everything about this chromebook .####['laptop general']
