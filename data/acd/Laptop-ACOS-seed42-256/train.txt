i ' ll wait a while until this device gets 4 - 5 stars .####['laptop operation performance']
overall , it is not horrible , but i wouldn ' t purchase this model again .####['laptop general']
- screen feels smaller than other of the same size .####['display design features']
i already returned the first laptop because i had to press extremely hard to get the left click to work .####['laptop general']
it also refuses to charge past 90 % and instantly jumps to 80 % when i unplug it .####['laptop operation performance']

it appears the adapter may still be good as there are a few sparks when plugging into power but the charging light on the laptop does not come on and the battery is not charging .####['hardware operation performance', 'battery operation performance', 'hardware quality', 'power supply operation performance', 'battery quality']

i would not recommend you buying this laptop , the specs are fine for the price , but the hardware is rubbish .####['hardware general', 'laptop price', 'laptop general']
thanks to its ssd , it boots windows 10 pretty fast , bloatware is kept to a minimum ( please uninstall norton before doing anything else .####['os operation performance']
oh , and the nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least ( grid autosport fps avg is in the 80s / 90s or so )####['graphics operation performance']
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####['display design features', 'laptop price']
- trackpad is too finicky and not my favorite####['hardware usability']
as of now , for $ 600 or less , this is a nice buy .####['laptop price']
best pc bang for this level of buck .####['laptop general']
- the backlit keyboard looks nice .####['keyboard design features']
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####['hard disc design features']
the screen looks great ( though maybe not if all you do is look at 4k resolution ) and the keyboard response feels pretty good .####['display design features', 'keyboard operation performance']
people said it wasn ' t bright enough but i run at 50 to 75 percent and its white bright .####['display operation performance']

this chromebook was one of the best gift to my grandauther .####['laptop general']
one of my favorite things i own####['laptop general']
the only problem is that there is no caps lock button on the keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
great cheap tool for web development ( using linux ) and everyday internet usage .####['laptop price']
the only thing is that it does ' t have too much storage room .####['memory general']
such a perfect little computer .####['laptop general']
so far no problems except i tried to print something from my email and am having trouble linking to my printer .####['laptop connectivity']
this is a great notebook .####['laptop general']

lenovo has not disappointed with their products .####['company general', 'laptop general']
the computer has a solid processor and enough memory to handle pretty much anything the average user willl throw at it , short of graphics - heavy gaming .####['memory quality']
it is an okay laptop and nothing more .####['laptop general']
beautiful resolution####['display general']
great item !####['laptop general']
this is actually the first laptop that fitted all my needs , big clear screen , battery life sucks but this is a power house laptop meant to be in one place since its so big , very good computer replacement , amazing sound and screen and very fast .####['display design features', 'display general', 'battery operation performance', 'multimedia devices general', 'laptop general']
you just have to deal with a low battery and that ' s all####['battery operation performance']
pretty fast processor .####['cpu operation performance']
it was easy to set up .####['laptop usability']
so before you get angry do your homework on why the laptop may be acting strange .####['laptop general']
that said if you ' re not a computer savvy no worries as soon as you turn it on cortana the computers assistant walks you through everything that you need to do .####['os general']
also can not just ` ` add ` ` memory ddms : only one socket means you must remove the 8gb and purchace a 16gb ( ~ $ 180 further investment ) ; battery not gon na last several hrs , looking at ~ 2 - 4 .####['battery operation performance', 'memory general']
the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####['os operation performance']
great buy .####['laptop general']
the only draw back with this pc is the battery life which lasts about 3 hrs before needing to be charged .####['battery operation performance']
for reference : ive had this laptop for about 4 months now for my first year at college .####['laptop general']
if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .####['laptop general']
i like the size but dislike the battery life .####['laptop design features', 'battery general']

i will see if samsung honors their warrnty , if so , i will probably change / update this review .####['company general']
returning it into a standard laptop position did not help , the screen actually turned dark and only closing and opening the lid helped return it to normal state .####['display operation performance']
first and foremost , lets talk about the infamous keyboard .####['keyboard general']
yes , it ' s absolute garbage .####['keyboard general']
i ' m surprised people are settling for claiming ` ` it ' s good enough ` ` or ` ` gets the job done ` ` when every time i use it , i ' m constantly reminded of how i should have just sprang for the pixelbook when it was on sale for $ 699 .####['laptop price']
my 2nd issues is with it ' s performance .####['laptop operation performance']
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####['laptop operation performance']
i haven ' t abused this at all , and i noticed a small crack in the screen today and it ' s starting to spider out .####['display quality']
awesome display .####['display general']
mouse track pad is non standard .####['hardware operation performance']
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####['laptop price']
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####['hardware operation performance']
10 minutes after finishing this review started having a new issue : touch pad started acting out .####['hardware operation performance']
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .####['display general']
sent it in , arrived back in an inadequate box ( i shipped it in the oroginal with protective foam came back in the box from samsung w / o any protection ) and 3 days after i recieved the item back the stylus fell apart .####['hardware quality']
it fancies itself a convertible notebook / app consuming functional tablet , but it is not .####['laptop general']
certain apps ( especially flash based apps ) will get the machine very hot .####['software operation performance']
the keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice .####['keyboard general']
bought this for someone else , can ' t believe how good it is .####['laptop general']
the keys on the keyboard are sunk in a little too low to accommodate for the sleek / thin profile .####['keyboard design features']
it on the developer channel and have full access to the play store .####['laptop usability']
this acer chromebook 14 is by far the best chromebook 300 dollars can buy .####['laptop price']
overall , the way i see it , i ' m getting a big screen hd android galaxy tablet with a keyboard for the price of a tablet .####['laptop price']
the keyboard is a delight with large , nearly flush , keys set to just the right level of resistance and sensitivity .####['keyboard design features']
the base model went up in price $ 400 , which excludes any performance benefits .####['laptop price']
while usb - c is cool , a bag full of dongles is not .####['ports general']
the one i purchased wasn ' t the cheapest but for peace of mind i gladly paid it .####['laptop general']
- new radeon graphics card ( finally ! )####['graphics general']
i thought that it wouldn ' t make any difference , but it does on games####['display operation performance']

when the computer is working hard , it doesn ' t burn my lap anymore ( although i do feel some hot air flowing through my fingertips , when i am typing , but i am okay with that ) .####['fans&cooling general']
i don ' t like this .####['ports general']
the click is now provided by a haptic engine and provides more functionality .####['hardware design features']
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .####['keyboard general']
overall , i feel this is the best laptop i ' ve ever purchased or used .####['laptop general']
regardless to the fact that the outside box was damaged , the inside box was fine .####['shipping general']
i predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 ( frostbyte 3 engine ) that this machine will perform well with the impending starwars battlefront ( also frostbyte 3 ) .####['laptop operation performance']
with the windows 10 / directx 12 improvements , frostbite 3 games will do very well on this machine at 1050p graphics / medium / low with the new starwars game .####['laptop operation performance']

good quality all around hardware + software , of course that is what apple is known for .####['software quality', 'company general', 'hardware quality']
well , i have to say , i ' m fairly impressed with my new chrome flipbook !####['laptop general']
i ' ve used it for 3 days and still have n ' t plugged it in !####['battery quality']

` ` this thing is neat . ` `####['laptop usability']
there nwere complaints regarding the lousy screen resolution , as well as the mouse pad not working well .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance']
not sure what the deal is but extremely disappointed .####['laptop general']
it turns out that it ' s not a stain , but the anti - reflective coating coming off .####['laptop quality']
ive researched this and it is very common and apple says it ' s normal .####['support general']
had it for a week now and still finding things it can not do .####['laptop operation performance']
this is a great computer .####['laptop general']
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####['laptop quality', 'laptop general']

vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####['software operation performance']
i bought this as a gift and was incredibly disappointed as it did n ' t even turn on after the initial charging .####['laptop general']
this is not an inexpensive product , especially for a chrome book but , i figured you get what you pay for .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
yay amazon customer service they replaced it immediately for me no questions asked .####['support general']
after about 60 days use the power adapter / charger stopped working .####['power supply operation performance']
the computer is great , but the charger is garbage .####['power supply general', 'laptop general']
android ` ` the computer will recognize your cellphone ` ` system never works .####['software operation performance']
sadly after barely a year old it crashes all the time , the touch screen rarely works , and the track pad stops working until a reboot on occasion .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance']
i will never buy another asus after this experience .####['laptop general']
today , it stopped powering on .####['power supply operation performance']
i love the way it looks and feels the only thing i can complain about is the fact that none of these electronics come with printed manuels anymore also dont know anything about the camera only see me .####['laptop design features', 'multimedia devices usability']
the chromebook seems to be working fine now and my daughter does love it .####['laptop general']
however , the speakers are already starting to crackle , and i haven ' t even had the thing for a week .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
i still love the laptop , i ' m just a bit disappointed by this and i hope it ' s the only issue i see .####['laptop general']
customer service is difficult .####['support operation performance']
google play support is lip service only .####['support quality']
hardware is still pretty sound .####['hardware operation performance']
it began to shut down and restart all on it ' s own - continuously .####['laptop operation performance']
it sounded clean and simple , exactly what we need .####['multimedia devices quality']
keeping the msi software is optional , a few of these are useful like burnrecovery to make a backup of your version of windows just in case anything happens .####['software usability', 'software general']
keyboard problems too .####['keyboard general']
second where the heck is my other 8 gigs of ram ?####['memory general']
i ' ve never had a computer as fast as this .####['laptop operation performance']
i don ' t know if i got a defective model or what , but something has gone wrong every time i boot up my computer .####['laptop quality']
it took hours to restore to factory default settings , and it crashed once again days later .####['laptop operation performance']
it ' s a very fast laptop .####['laptop operation performance']
i definitely recommend this if you are looking for a good gaming laptop .####['laptop general']
very good looking and fast laptop if only if it would stop crashing and having to reset back to default settings .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features', 'laptop quality']

this unit is a great compromise between powerful cpu and gpu with good battery life .####['cpu operation performance', 'graphics operation performance', 'battery general', 'laptop general']
i called acer tech support but nothing worked .####['support general']
the screen sits too close to the keyboard and you will end up with scratches on the screen .####['keyboard design features']
when i play a game , there is noise on the screen .####['display operation performance']
the laptop itself seemed fine at first .####['laptop general']
i left it plugged in to charge for the night and tried it again the next morning , with the same results of not being able to turn it back on .####['laptop general']
i hate to knock acer as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new product and then not being able to turn it on to use it .####['company general', 'laptop general']
i ' ve called apple support numerous times and was never asked if i had the ability to read words as i ' m actually reading words .####['support general']
the seller doesn ' t reply my e - mails####['support quality']
usb ports are too hard to plug and unplug####['ports usability']
i can enjoy the real potential of this laptop .####['laptop operation performance']

this item cost me money .####['laptop general']
- the hard drive is really slow and really loud .####['hard disc operation performance']

one place that i find lacking in chromeos is the settings management .####['os design features']

this thing is n ' t that fast , but for loading web pages , it ' s pretty close .####['cpu operation performance']
the touch screen is super responsive and the keyboard is excellent .####['keyboard general', 'display operation performance']
