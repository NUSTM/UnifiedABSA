now i ' m really bummed that i have a very nice looking chromebook with a beautiful screen that is totally unusable .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features', 'display operation performance']
i ' ll wait a while until this device gets 4 - 5 stars .####['laptop operation performance']
overall , this thing can do very basic stuff , sometimes .####['laptop general']
keyboard key fragile .####['keyboard quality']
overall , it is not horrible , but i wouldn ' t purchase this model again .####['laptop general']
- screen feels smaller than other of the same size .####['display design features']
i already returned the first laptop because i had to press extremely hard to get the left click to work .####['laptop general']
it also refuses to charge past 90 % and instantly jumps to 80 % when i unplug it .####['laptop operation performance']
the flip and touchscreen aspects work fine , no problems .####['hardware operation performance']
it worked properly for less than a week , and the touch screen stopped functioning again .####['laptop operation performance', 'hardware quality']
good display####['display general']
my understanding is that chromeos is a very light weight so i don ' t know why it lags sometimes with under 10 tabs open and a youtube video playing .####['os operation performance']
i tried messing around in the dev mode to adjust the microphone sensitivity but nothing seems to work .####['multimedia devices general']
microphone is not really working ( you have to basically yell while alsmost touching it with you lips in order for someone else to hear you ) .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
when switching between tablet and laptop mode quickly the screen will blink and turn off for an extended period of time before turning back on .####['display operation performance']
called acer support , they were completely useless .####['support general']

it feels like a tablet / computer for a child since it ' s so bulky and heavy .####['laptop general']
am i just unlucky , or was this a bad batch ?####['laptop quality']
it appears the adapter may still be good as there are a few sparks when plugging into power but the charging light on the laptop does not come on and the battery is not charging .####['hardware operation performance', 'battery operation performance', 'hardware quality', 'power supply operation performance', 'battery quality']
i will return it .####['laptop general']
it was fully charged and i only turned it on a total of 3 times before the screen went blank .####['laptop operation performance', 'display operation performance']
the built - in speaker is below average .####['multimedia devices general']
i will constantly be thinking about how it will probably fall apart in a few moths .####['laptop quality']
aside from that , laptop seems fine .####['laptop general']
no backlit keyboard is kinda a bummer but i digress .####['keyboard design features']
sad that i can ' t return this one .####['warranty general']
with this asus i ' m experiencing 2 very disappointing issues .####['laptop general']
graphic issues : after opening any page or window with a black or dark color and i go back to a more bright or white page it takes at least 5 good second to gain the full luminosity####['graphics operation performance']
the m key popped off during initial setup .####['keyboard quality']
amazon is 2 - day shipping me a replacement .####['company general']
camera is sd but not a problem .####['hardware general']
back lit keyboard should be a standard by now !####['keyboard general']
my friends , both female and male , are going to by this set up for their travel needs but for me it is lacking .####['laptop usability']
the computer constantly pauses or stutters and then continues when it comes to loading web pages and working on documents .####['laptop quality']
the laptop does n ' t work .####['laptop quality']
unable to contact asus support for help .####['support general']
should ' ve stick with my pixelbook which was awesome and never have me trouble .####['laptop general']
no backlighting on the keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
i would not recommend you buying this laptop , the specs are fine for the price , but the hardware is rubbish .####['hardware general', 'laptop price', 'laptop general']
* * returning the device - - that unhappy with the item .####['laptop general']
do not buy it will not search what you type in i want my money back####['laptop general']
thanks to its ssd , it boots windows 10 pretty fast , bloatware is kept to a minimum ( please uninstall norton before doing anything else .####['os operation performance']
oh , and the nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least ( grid autosport fps avg is in the 80s / 90s or so )####['graphics operation performance']
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####['display design features', 'laptop price']
- trackpad is too finicky and not my favorite####['hardware usability']
as of now , for $ 600 or less , this is a nice buy .####['laptop price']
- ips full hd screen .####['display general']
best pc bang for this level of buck .####['laptop general']
i highly recommend this laptop for anyone looking for a great performing machine with an outstanding price ( just to be clear , it won ' t be running the newest high - end games on ultra - high graphics settings , but it still performs phenomenally for its price range and usage category ) .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop price']
it is also amazingly quiet : the ssd doesn ' t make any noise , and the fan only spins up if i am doing something intensive like playing games or running a heafty program - just browsing or watching videos / basic office work will not make this computer more than whisper .####['hardware operation performance']
- the backlit keyboard looks nice .####['keyboard design features']
- windows 10 ( do i really need to list the drawbacks of 10 ?####['os operation performance']
it ' s lightning fast and handles games like skyrim and the witcher 3 surprisingly smoothly for the price i paid .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop price']
after running good for the initial 25 first days it won ' t power on .####['laptop operation performance']
i will painfully learn the new pads .####['hardware usability']
i ' ve owned several acer monitors that i ' ve always been pleased with , but this is the first computer .####['display general', 'laptop general']
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####['hard disc design features']
the screen looks great ( though maybe not if all you do is look at 4k resolution ) and the keyboard response feels pretty good .####['display design features', 'keyboard operation performance']
people said it wasn ' t bright enough but i run at 50 to 75 percent and its white bright .####['display operation performance']
for the price , it ' s a solid laptop .####['laptop price']
the keyboard is easy to type on ( and the backlight is an added plus ) .####['keyboard operation performance']
i added an sd card which has expanded on the 16gb of storage .####['memory general']
chromebooks are light weight and start up immediately and are very easy to use .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features', 'laptop usability']
the keyboard is easy to use , and there is no external noise to contend with .####['keyboard operation performance']
i use it sort of all day and night and i haven ' t found anything it won ' t do .####['laptop general']
the keyboard is nice .####['keyboard general']
it ' s absolutely silent .####['laptop quality']
first time chrome os user , very streamlined and easy to use .####['os usability']
it doesn ' t get super loud , but for normal usage situations it ' s fine .####['laptop operation performance']
overall , the problems are fairly minor and for the price i ' m happy with what i got .####['laptop price']
it looks nice .####['laptop design features']
great price - i always buy the warranty .####['laptop price', 'warranty general']
fast shipping too !####['shipping quality']

it is a good product to buy .####['laptop general']
it arrived as promised and was exactly as described .####['shipping quality']
one of my favorite things i own####['laptop general']
the only problem is that there is no caps lock button on the keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
i would buy again , especially at this price .####['laptop price']
google docs are getting so good and user friendly who needs office anymore , content accessible anywhere , just takes a little time to get used to but once you realize all the benefits chromebook is a great choice .####['laptop quality', 'software operation performance']
great cheap tool for web development ( using linux ) and everyday internet usage .####['laptop price']
the only thing is that it does ' t have too much storage room .####['memory general']
such a perfect little computer .####['laptop general']
not happy that the l and the quotation mark key no longer work unless i bang on them .####['keyboard quality']
for the price i think it ' s just fine .####['laptop price']
so far no problems except i tried to print something from my email and am having trouble linking to my printer .####['laptop connectivity']
we are loving this chromebook !####['laptop general']
this is a great notebook .####['laptop general']
but you ca n ' t beat the price .####['laptop price']
i love this little chrome book .####['laptop general']
package arrived faster than the estimated arrival .####['shipping operation performance']
has all the top features and runs fast .####['laptop operation performance']
i woudlnt recommend more than 10 active tabs which slows down some of the functionality but otherwise runs smoothly for students####['laptop operation performance']
battery works well , i get nearly 4 to 5 hours easily .####['battery operation performance']
this item is excellent and not bad for the price .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
choose this one .####['laptop general']
love this took place of my laptop .####['laptop general']
i bought this for a linux machine and it does that just great .####['laptop operation performance']
lenovo has not disappointed with their products .####['company general', 'laptop general']
2 ) the battery was pretty limited .####['battery operation performance']
the computer has a solid processor and enough memory to handle pretty much anything the average user willl throw at it , short of graphics - heavy gaming .####['memory quality']
it is an okay laptop and nothing more .####['laptop general']
beautiful resolution####['display general']
great item !####['laptop general']
right out of the box , this computer is really slow , but two simple steps easily fix that issue .####['laptop general']
this is actually the first laptop that fitted all my needs , big clear screen , battery life sucks but this is a power house laptop meant to be in one place since its so big , very good computer replacement , amazing sound and screen and very fast .####['display design features', 'display general', 'battery operation performance', 'multimedia devices general', 'laptop general']
highly recommend , great value , use computer mainly for online business and is quick and easy to use####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop usability', 'laptop general']
this laptop is the best of both worlds####['laptop general']
very happy with my purchase , fast delivery , package well .####['shipping quality', 'laptop general']
good laptop .####['laptop general']
you just have to deal with a low battery and that ' s all####['battery operation performance']
it is a little slow at times though .####['laptop operation performance']
love this computer !####['laptop general']
pretty fast processor .####['cpu operation performance']
photoshop also runs very well .####['software operation performance']
great service with amazon on fulfilling my order .####['support general']
if you need a decent computer that runs quality this is it , especially if you are starting out .####['laptop general']
love the price reduction and the lenova one year warranty .####['laptop price', 'warranty general']
it ' s also very lightweight , so it ' s easy to carry around .####['laptop design features', 'laptop portability']
it was easy to set up .####['laptop usability']
laptop meets spec for what it was purchased to do but disappointed it was shipped with a charger not compatible with location it was shipped to ( needed to buy an adapter to convert from 2 pin to 3 pin plug )####['shipping general', 'laptop general']
i don ' t really have anywhere to rest my hand when i use it because it ' s so large .####['keyboard design features']
plenty of memory and storage .####['memory general', 'hard disc general']
so before you get angry do your homework on why the laptop may be acting strange .####['laptop general']
great computer .####['laptop general']
that said if you ' re not a computer savvy no worries as soon as you turn it on cortana the computers assistant walks you through everything that you need to do .####['os general']
also can not just ` ` add ` ` memory ddms : only one socket means you must remove the 8gb and purchace a 16gb ( ~ $ 180 further investment ) ; battery not gon na last several hrs , looking at ~ 2 - 4 .####['battery operation performance', 'memory general']
the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####['os operation performance']
have had mine for about 3 - 4 wks and have had no trouble .####['laptop general']
8g is enough to do most daily activities , i use nvidia geforce now to play much higher end games like destiny 2 , r6 and what not .####['graphics general']
great buy .####['laptop general']
the only draw back with this pc is the battery life which lasts about 3 hrs before needing to be charged .####['battery operation performance']
i do like it , just now that i had time to use it in preparing for my exams , the following was observed : -####['laptop general']
otherwise , it ' s a good computer .####['laptop general']
it ' s pretty fast even with heavy use and multiple applications running at once .####['laptop operation performance']
fantastic computer .####['laptop general']
for reference : ive had this laptop for about 4 months now for my first year at college .####['laptop general']
if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .####['laptop general']
youtube works well on here .####['software operation performance']
easy to use and set up .####['laptop usability']
really happy with this laptop !####['laptop general']
price and product , outstanding .####['laptop price']
i like the size but dislike the battery life .####['laptop design features', 'battery general']
still learning but it ' s a good computer and a great deal####['laptop general']
when i called they would not accept the serial number .####['support general']
don ' t buy it .####['laptop general']
i like everything about the device , but the beautiful touchscreen ended up malfunctioning about 6 - months after purchase .####['display quality', 'display design features', 'laptop general']
i will see if samsung honors their warrnty , if so , i will probably change / update this review .####['company general']
returning it into a standard laptop position did not help , the screen actually turned dark and only closing and opening the lid helped return it to normal state .####['display operation performance']
in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this product given the obvious history of quality control issues .####['laptop quality']
first and foremost , lets talk about the infamous keyboard .####['keyboard general']
yes , it ' s absolute garbage .####['keyboard general']
i ' m surprised people are settling for claiming ` ` it ' s good enough ` ` or ` ` gets the job done ` ` when every time i use it , i ' m constantly reminded of how i should have just sprang for the pixelbook when it was on sale for $ 699 .####['laptop price']
my 2nd issues is with it ' s performance .####['laptop operation performance']
even in the early rounds the frames are heavily compromised and the entire game feels very sluggish .####['software operation performance']
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####['laptop operation performance']
i haven ' t abused this at all , and i noticed a small crack in the screen today and it ' s starting to spider out .####['display quality']
i just wanted to make it known my personal experiences with the device .####['laptop operation performance']
awesome display .####['display general']
mouse track pad is non standard .####['hardware operation performance']
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####['laptop price']
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####['hardware operation performance']
10 minutes after finishing this review started having a new issue : touch pad started acting out .####['hardware operation performance']
so one star off for the keyboard .####['keyboard general']
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .####['display general']
i really needed this product for work and had big plans for using it ' s features / versatility .####['laptop operation performance']
all i got was a fancy 2lb metal slab that can only be used to swat flies .####['laptop operation performance']
sent it in , arrived back in an inadequate box ( i shipped it in the oroginal with protective foam came back in the box from samsung w / o any protection ) and 3 days after i recieved the item back the stylus fell apart .####['hardware quality']
it fancies itself a convertible notebook / app consuming functional tablet , but it is not .####['laptop general']
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####['os usability']
certain apps ( especially flash based apps ) will get the machine very hot .####['software operation performance']
it also has much better performance , including an easily upgraded m .####['laptop operation performance']
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####['laptop general']
the keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice .####['keyboard general']
bought this for someone else , can ' t believe how good it is .####['laptop general']
the keys on the keyboard are sunk in a little too low to accommodate for the sleek / thin profile .####['keyboard design features']
now it kind of feels a little bit like windows but still different .####['os design features']
it on the developer channel and have full access to the play store .####['laptop usability']
the keyboard is good .####['keyboard general']
the battery life has started to go down after a year of solid use ( still quite good ) , but the quality screen and chromeos make it worth it .####['battery operation performance', 'display quality', 'os quality']
this acer chromebook 14 is by far the best chromebook 300 dollars can buy .####['laptop price']
the build quality is good ( all aluminum body ) .####['laptop quality']
the chromebook is quite ideal for those who use their computer mostly for surfing the internet .####['laptop miscellaneous']
overall , the way i see it , i ' m getting a big screen hd android galaxy tablet with a keyboard for the price of a tablet .####['laptop price']
the keyboard is a delight with large , nearly flush , keys set to just the right level of resistance and sensitivity .####['keyboard design features']
the base model went up in price $ 400 , which excludes any performance benefits .####['laptop price']
while usb - c is cool , a bag full of dongles is not .####['ports general']
happy i got a great machine for half the cost !####['laptop price']
the one i purchased wasn ' t the cheapest but for peace of mind i gladly paid it .####['laptop general']
- new radeon graphics card ( finally ! )####['graphics general']
i thought that it wouldn ' t make any difference , but it does on games####['display operation performance']
that is awesome .####['hard disc general']
when the computer is working hard , it doesn ' t burn my lap anymore ( although i do feel some hot air flowing through my fingertips , when i am typing , but i am okay with that ) .####['fans&cooling general']
- ssd ( solid state drive ) is not easily upgradable .####['hard disc general']
i don ' t like this .####['ports general']
- the screen is harder to clean .####['display design features']
in the beginning i felt a little weird about this trackpad .####['hardware general']
the keyboard is ok .####['keyboard general']
the click is now provided by a haptic engine and provides more functionality .####['hardware design features']
the thing is fantastic .####['hardware general']
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .####['keyboard general']
i ' m not sure when this feature was introduced , but it is very welcome .####['software general']
overall , i feel this is the best laptop i ' ve ever purchased or used .####['laptop general']
regardless to the fact that the outside box was damaged , the inside box was fine .####['shipping general']
i ' m glad i got this .####['laptop general']
for some of us , even though they are more expensive , they still offer the better value .####['laptop price', 'laptop quality']
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####['software general', 'software operation performance']
i predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 ( frostbyte 3 engine ) that this machine will perform well with the impending starwars battlefront ( also frostbyte 3 ) .####['laptop operation performance']
with the windows 10 / directx 12 improvements , frostbite 3 games will do very well on this machine at 1050p graphics / medium / low with the new starwars game .####['laptop operation performance']
but i fed up with the price it cost to upgrade the product as well as the software .####['laptop price']
computer looked excellent .####['laptop design features']
but the mac looked and worked great .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
it is a small , light , powerful device that until 2016 seemed custom fit for content creators , photographers , and other such lines of work or hobbies .####['laptop design features']
has a long battery life .####['battery operation performance']
as of now , highly recommended refurbished products####['laptop general']
well macbook is no less than expected .####['laptop general']
this new generation macbook has a fast processor , great retina display , 13 inch high resolution screen , great compatibility and many more .####['display quality', 'cpu operation performance', 'display general', 'laptop usability']

wonderful machine fast , clean , solid i have to said that this guy i fell from my hands the first day i use , goes to the floor and nothing happens screen is perfect and nothing is damage !####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features', 'display general', 'laptop general']
this is my first macbook pro i ' m impress !####['laptop general']
what an excellent computer .####['laptop general']
as a refurbished item it was indistinguishable from a new item .####['laptop general']
condition even better then i expect .####['laptop general']
the mac works like a new one .####['laptop operation performance']
it has been great for everything i ' ve done .####['laptop operation performance']
great price for a brand new product .####['laptop price']

feel totally comfortable with it , and will never go back to a pc .####['laptop operation performance']
this laptop is incredibly lightweight and slim ( ultimately won me over after years of lugging around a whopping 5lb levono ) .####['laptop design features']
overall , i ' m very happy i chose this model .####['laptop general']
i love it , it is as shown on the picture####['laptop general']
a great laptop !####['laptop general']
works exactly like it ' s supposed to work !####['laptop operation performance']
excellent packaging .####['shipping general']
good quality all around hardware + software , of course that is what apple is known for .####['software quality', 'company general', 'hardware quality']
excellent quality and very fast delivery .####['shipping general', 'laptop quality']
if you purchase this product , go into it with realistic expectations and patience getting familiar with the setup and you ' ll probably love it , too !####['laptop general']
well , i have to say , i ' m fairly impressed with my new chrome flipbook !####['laptop general']
i ' ve used it for 3 days and still have n ' t plugged it in !####['battery quality']
i feel like this will look good in any decade .####['laptop design features']
i boot it up and notice quickly the display seems to be 720p ( or something close ) but for what i need this thing to do .####['display operation performance']
` ` this thing is neat . ` `####['laptop usability']
i chose this one mainly because of the full size keyboard , larger screen , and full size hdmi .####['display design features', 'keyboard design features', 'ports design features']
there nwere complaints regarding the lousy screen resolution , as well as the mouse pad not working well .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance']
not sure what the deal is but extremely disappointed .####['laptop general']
the laptop is in great physical conditions , no scratches or anything , but certain actions run slowly , specifically any file read or write , like copying a document , uploading an image , creating a new file , etc .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
the other weird thing is a ` ` popping ` ` noise i keep getting when i use the tracking pad .####['hardware quality']
it turns out that it ' s not a stain , but the anti - reflective coating coming off .####['laptop quality']
ive researched this and it is very common and apple says it ' s normal .####['support general']
your new retina screen will get stains on it from the top layer seperating and or dead pixels .####['display quality']
had it for a week now and still finding things it can not do .####['laptop operation performance']
this is a great computer .####['laptop general']
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####['laptop quality', 'laptop general']
lo and behold , i hadn ' t read quite all of the 1 * reviews : the worst was a teacher who had ordered so many for her several classes and said ` ` i think the problem is with the motherboard .####['motherboard quality']
needless to say , android / play rollout is being managed very , very poorly .####['software operation performance']
for the moment , please note - * * * this product no longer works with the google play store in stable or beta * * * and there is no communication about what we can expect , or when .####['software operation performance']
- the m3 processor is * plenty * of power for all chrome , video , and android requirements .####['cpu quality']
but after only a couple of days the thing just turned off and won ' t turn back on again .####['laptop general']
i ' ve had mine 10 months and the motherboard has crapped out twice already .####['motherboard operation performance']
the build quality is fantastic .####['laptop design features']
my disappointment begins with the fact that chromeos is not touch - ready and most websites will not consider touch interface for desktop mode websites .####['os usability']
• bright screen with good colors####['display quality']
it just is missing a lot of other features that i wanted in a notebook####['laptop design features']
vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####['software operation performance']
i bought this as a gift and was incredibly disappointed as it did n ' t even turn on after the initial charging .####['laptop general']
this is not an inexpensive product , especially for a chrome book but , i figured you get what you pay for .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
yay amazon customer service they replaced it immediately for me no questions asked .####['support general']
the second one arrived , i had it from end of may june , to september started to notice the a key was a bit unresponsive at times .####['keyboard operation performance']
it gets rave reviews both on the ' net and amazon .####['laptop general']
it has one serious flaw though which is that the audio out can not drive headphones ( or earbuds ) adequately .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
after about 60 days use the power adapter / charger stopped working .####['power supply operation performance']
- it freezes up depending on the program you use and you have to restart it .####['laptop operation performance']
works great as a chromebook but chromebooks are still very limited for android compatibility , at least this one is .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop usability']
the computer is great , but the charger is garbage .####['power supply general', 'laptop general']
it was terrible .####['laptop general']
i can ' t recommend purchasing this based on what happens if you need support .####['laptop general']
the sound and screen quality is low .####['multimedia devices quality', 'display quality']
android ` ` the computer will recognize your cellphone ` ` system never works .####['software operation performance']
sadly after barely a year old it crashes all the time , the touch screen rarely works , and the track pad stops working until a reboot on occasion .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance']
i will never buy another asus after this experience .####['laptop general']
oh and the customer service is garbage .####['support general']
great little machine while it was functioning 100 % .####['laptop general']
extremely disappointed as this was a gift to my husband .####['laptop general']
today , it stopped powering on .####['power supply operation performance']
so sad to report that after only a few weeks my asus chromebook has a hairline fracture .####['laptop general']
i love the way it looks and feels the only thing i can complain about is the fact that none of these electronics come with printed manuels anymore also dont know anything about the camera only see me .####['laptop design features', 'multimedia devices usability']
chromebook is 2 months old and charger stopped working .####['power supply operation performance']
the chromebook seems to be working fine now and my daughter does love it .####['laptop general']
however , the speakers are already starting to crackle , and i haven ' t even had the thing for a week .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
i still love the laptop , i ' m just a bit disappointed by this and i hope it ' s the only issue i see .####['laptop general']
i opened the box after ordering on black friday , and the machine wouldn ' t charge .####['power supply operation performance']
customer service is difficult .####['support operation performance']
however , the resolution could be higher , the scaling is bad , the colors are a bit washy , the weight is off as said earlier , the keys are kinda awkward , travel could be more , and the keys start squeaking soon after use####['display general', 'keyboard quality', 'laptop general', 'display quality', 'keyboard general', 'software general']
the keyboard broke after three months and it has been difficult to get any help from the manufacturer .####['keyboard quality']
video playback is poor with the amazon prime video player .####['software operation performance']
google play support is lip service only .####['support quality']
hardware is still pretty sound .####['hardware operation performance']
nice piece but battery holds only 3h - not 10 .####['battery operation performance', 'laptop general']
it began to shut down and restart all on it ' s own - continuously .####['laptop operation performance']
it sounded clean and simple , exactly what we need .####['multimedia devices quality']
the screen is only pretty good .####['display general']
very fast product , but with this kind of technology it ' s not possible to use a program , that i work ( minitab ) .####['laptop operation performance']
cpu and ram were running low .####['hard disc operation performance', 'cpu operation performance']
gpu wasn ' t drawing a lot of power because i was playing world of warcraft on the recommended settings .####['graphics operation performance']
got my replacement recently and i haven ' t had any major issues so far .####['laptop general']
keeping the msi software is optional , a few of these are useful like burnrecovery to make a backup of your version of windows just in case anything happens .####['software usability', 'software general']
keyboard problems too .####['keyboard general']

the trackpad is mediocre in use .####['hardware operation performance']
i can ' t really testify to its battery - life as i have not used it to the point where the battery is totally dissipated .####['battery operation performance']
it ' s easy find and delete pics and files you ' ve downloaded .####['laptop usability']
it ' s still good for basic internet usage .####['laptop operation performance']
this happened 7 times within 20 minutes when i was working on something .####['laptop operation performance']
unfortunately this chromebook is very sluggish .####['laptop operation performance']
acer support is awful .####['support quality']
third time in 5 months that the touchpad became unresponsive .####['hardware operation performance']
very low quality build and quality support .####['support quality', 'laptop quality']

this unit is a great compromise between powerful cpu and gpu with good battery life .####['cpu operation performance', 'graphics operation performance', 'battery general', 'laptop general']
i called acer tech support but nothing worked .####['support general']
the screen sits too close to the keyboard and you will end up with scratches on the screen .####['keyboard design features']
when i play a game , there is noise on the screen .####['display operation performance']
the laptop itself seemed fine at first .####['laptop general']
i left it plugged in to charge for the night and tried it again the next morning , with the same results of not being able to turn it back on .####['laptop general']
i hate to knock acer as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new product and then not being able to turn it on to use it .####['company general', 'laptop general']
keyboard lighting is primitive and keeps shutting off .####['keyboard design features']
i ' ve called apple support numerous times and was never asked if i had the ability to read words as i ' m actually reading words .####['support general']

the fingerprint sensor is a nice touch and the color and feel of the laptop material is also nice .####['laptop design features', 'hardware operation performance']
15 ` ` screen , full sized keyboard and speed fast enough for some low quality games such as lol .####['laptop operation performance', 'keyboard design features']
it ' s light and thin , and overall the screen is pretty good .####['laptop design features', 'display general']
everything is plastic .####['laptop design features']
the hard drive sounds like a distant lawn mower .####['hard disc operation performance']
so the audio can easily be muffled .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
- track pad is accurate####['hardware operation performance']
after only a little over a month , it totally died and will not work at all .####['laptop quality']
this item cost me money .####['laptop general']

it is going on 3 hours now and is only 17 % done .####['os operation performance']
this computer freeze , reboots , and crashes in a regular basis if you ' re trying to do multiple stuff at once .####['laptop operation performance']
it ' s a pretty good laptop .####['laptop general']
thing says 8 hours , but i can guarantee it ' s not making it past 4 or 5 .####['battery operation performance']
replacement ordered and arrived , upon first ten minutes of use the keyboard stops working and is barely functioning sound on max is extremely undesirable .####['keyboard quality']

can ' t say enough about my love of this chromebook .####['laptop general']
the touch screen is super responsive and the keyboard is excellent .####['keyboard general', 'display operation performance']
the track pad is excellent .####['keyboard general']
this laptop performs in every way .####['laptop operation performance']
- the touchscreen is very responsive , fast , and so far everything has scaled just fine during use####['hardware operation performance']
and because of the constant usage of higher brightness , the battery does drain faster .####['battery operation performance']
other than my hope that it would be light enough to use as a tablet all the time , this is the chromebook i ' ve been wanting for a long time now .####['laptop portability']
the design and style is topnotch .####['laptop design features']
the keyboard is fully sized and comfortable , the key travel is good with great action , backlighting is enough and adaptive .####['keyboard operation performance', 'keyboard design features', 'keyboard quality']

i absolutely love this chromebook !####['laptop general']

performance wise , this is an excellent machine - it has a beautiful touchscreen , plenty of storage , converts to a tablet , and seamlessly connects to the google play store to run any of the millions of android apps available .####['display design features', 'memory design features']
sound has been fine , except for a few issues with an android app , and that can easily be software related as android is still in infant stages ( or at least toddler ) on chromebooks , and i expect those quirks will smooth out over time as chromebook software is updated on a very regular basis .####['software operation performance']
android is running flawlessly so far , barring one minor incident with sound on clash of clans ( which went away on reboot ) .####['software operation performance']
fast , beautiful display , comfortable keyboard , and the android apps work well ( not great yet , but well ) .####['display design features', 'software operation performance', 'keyboard usability']

nice back lit keyboard , i like the screen , but in the end , it is the software that counts .####['keyboard general', 'software general', 'display general']
keyboard feels good .####['keyboard quality']
the asus is powerful enough to stream video , i watch tv on it , do all my google trainer work with it , and all my daily work too .####['laptop operation performance']

chrome has come a long way to be sure and in its optimized avatar on this system its very snappy .####['software operation performance']
i really like this chromebook .####['laptop general']
backlit keyboard is extremely viewable and comfortable .####['keyboard usability']
the good news is that the android features ( google play store apps ) work nearly across the board .####['software operation performance']
touch - screen features are responsive .####['display operation performance']
it served my needs of web browsing and word processing for a number of years , but its battery life had dwindled and neither the screen nor the processor can match this asus .####['display general', 'cpu general', 'battery general']
i absolutely love everything about this chromebook .####['laptop general']
please note that the track pad is way better than most .####['hardware general']

for me the extra storage , back light keyboard ( you ' ll love it ) , 2 in 1 factor , and great build quality made it a no - brainer .####['keyboard general', 'laptop quality', 'hard disc design features']
- backlit and solid keyboard ( not flimsy or cheap )####['keyboard design features']
- side buttons are responsive and well - made####['hardware design features', 'hardware operation performance']
overall , i am happy with it and would purchase it again .####['laptop general']
the sound isn ' t great on both devices but they ' ll suffice ; at least the asus speakers are side - firing and not coming from the bottom like the pro .####['multimedia devices design features']
i don ' t know why google print is so touchy .####['software operation performance']
the second is also a known trouble spot with android , and that is the microsd card .####['out of scope general']
the biggest reason for me to pick this laptop over others is the light - weight design and its overall spec .####['laptop design features']
it fit nicely into my backpack without taking up space or weighing me down .####['laptop portability']
this little silver bullet is compact , functional , and has held up to everything i ' ve thrown at it .####['laptop operation performance']
extremely disappointed that you can not run android apps on this chromebook , despite the description stating clearly that you can , and the seller responding to my question regarding this question .####['support general']
other than that i ' m pleased with the performance .####['laptop general']
the touchscreen is great and the backlit keyboard is fantastic .####['keyboard general', 'display general']
while i hate that it doesn ' t have a caps key , so i have to keep using the shift key to capitalize my letters , the device itself is lightweight , has a very nice backlit keyboard , and works well for the purposes of taking it on the road and using it with wifi at your local coffeeshop .####['keyboard general', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
