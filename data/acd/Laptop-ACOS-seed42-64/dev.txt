things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####['laptop quality', 'display general', 'laptop operation performance']

to say i ' m disappointed in this chromebook would be an understatement .####['laptop general']
