this unit is ` ` pretty ` ` and stylish , so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason .####['laptop design features']
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####['hardware general']
should not of bought this chromebook .####['laptop general']
the chromebook r 11 was hardly used and only a few months old .####['laptop usability']
some apps don ' t work but the play store is still in beta right now####['software general']
returning it after one day####['laptop general']
the screen is very dim however .####['display operation performance']
keyboard is decent with good travel .####['keyboard portability']
thin bezels allow for a compact frame####['laptop design features']
but my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises , both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk .####['fans&cooling operation performance']
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####['company general', 'laptop general']
it seems like there is a problem with the processor because it constantly starts and stops while i ' m trying to surf the web .####['cpu general']
pros : lightweight and looks nice .####['laptop portability', 'laptop general']
buy this computer and you ' ll be very happy with it .####['laptop price']
this is the best laptop for the price .####['laptop price']
i like that it ' s got the 8th generation i5 cpu .####['cpu general']
it boots in seconds although i usually just leave it on constantly .####['laptop operation performance']
the chromebook has instant connection and a hugely impressive 8 - hour battery life when left on .####['battery operation performance', 'laptop connectivity']
i just got it today and i love it !####['laptop general']
that being said , my son loves it .####['laptop general']
great computer and great value , our second chromebook and first one still doing fine just needed another for family .####['laptop general']
very easy to set up .####['laptop usability']
it is a basic little laptop and i love it .####['laptop general']
there is a lot of ' bang for your buck ' in the lenovo ideapad 320 .####['laptop general']
my only fair complaint is that it occasionally restarts itself without warning ( usually no more than once every day or two ) .####['laptop operation performance']
a good product !####['laptop general']
love this so much !####['laptop general']
i ' m using it mainly to store movies , and the 1 tb drive is nice .####['hard disc general']
nice keyboard .####['keyboard general']
so , i have had this laptop for almost a week and have put it through the ringer .####['laptop general']
if you ' re big on aesthetics then you ' ll love the look .####['laptop design features']
i will never use another microsoft program as long as i live .####['software general']
it has a full size keyboard , a number pad , a camera , and great big screen !####['keyboard design features', 'display design features']
very happy with this laptop although not a fan of windows 10 .####['laptop general', 'os general']
so far i ' m enjoying it .####['laptop general']
i tried it , and it is very limited for the current price of $ 550 .####['laptop operation performance']
many apps aren ' t ` ` compatible ` ` and even the ones that work , they look awful .####['software operation performance']
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####['laptop quality', 'display general', 'laptop operation performance']
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####['laptop price']
for home users , these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two - screening , to watching videos and calling family .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop price']
as a 5 - year chromebook veteran , i ' ve been waiting for this machine .####['laptop general']
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####['cpu operation performance', 'cpu price']
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####['laptop quality']
i was pleasantly surprised at how good it is .####['laptop general']
as a windows and mac user , i wasn ' t sure if i could benefit from using chromeos , but i find myself using it more than i anticipated .####['os general']
i had the chance to test the new radeon graphics card and it ' s really good .####['graphics general']
honestly , i think nobody uses these ports anyway .####['ports general']
maybe that ' s a consequence of how the retina display is built , but yeah , it ' s harder to keep the screen clean .####['display general']
these macbook pro computers are expensive .####['laptop price']
i am extremely happy with this laptop .####['laptop general']
the retina screen is amazing .####['display operation performance']
not to mention , the touchbar is just another gimmicky addition to the ` ` future of apple ` ` ( really not as effective as one would think ) .####['keyboard general']
battery life is a huge plus !####['battery operation performance']
such a nice mac####['laptop general']
price was very good and met my expectations also shipping was very quick .####['shipping general', 'laptop price']
it arrived on time and in excellent condition and my hubby has been happily using it now for several weeks with no problems .####['shipping general', 'laptop general']
this laptop has all the necessary ports .####['laptop design features']
as i bought 13 inch model , it is very portable .####['laptop portability']
the only drawback is that it only comes with 32 gb of hard drive .####['hard disc design features']
configuring the printer was a little tricky but not bad .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
my desktop runs all my video editing software for my bigger and most demanding projects and mylaptop is great for editing video and running pc games in places other than my home ( like school ! )####['laptop miscellaneous']
either they were so slow i couldn ' t get any work done or they just flat out broke after a couple months .####['laptop operation performance']
i have not had any freezing or screen flashing issues .####['display operation performance']
did i mention , i can access all my word , excel , and powerpoint files using the google apps .####['software usability']
i ' m disappointed with macbook pro 15 ” because sometimes charger macbook pro 15 ” running overheating !####['power supply operation performance', 'laptop general']
* extremely weak graphics card .####['graphics operation performance']
sometimes they felt a bit half - baked , but i loved the idea , and the keyboard made a world of difference in what you could do with that tablet .####['laptop general', 'keyboard general']
all metal body , very slim form factor , and has a pretty decent touchscreen .####['display general', 'laptop design features']
anyhow , within a week , the speakers started crackling annoyingly when watching videos , or playing games .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
the first issue is that the speakers are on either side of the computer , and you can barely hear them on max volume .####['multimedia devices design features']
it also had charging problems and got terrible warranty support .####['warranty general', 'power supply general']
i got the same failure to charge issue that others have reported .####['power supply general']
don ' t get me wrong , the device flips back and forth very well .####['laptop design features']
was initially impressed by design but after normal use without any rough handling or dropping of the chromebook , the metal corner tip covering the lcd peels off & warps / bends upwards !####['hardware quality']
it ' s their policy to only repair not replace .####['support quality']
other than this , it ' s a decent product .####['laptop general']
it will not power on anymore after 2 mos of daily use - 4 hours per day .####['laptop operation performance']
i really liked it when i first got it , it performs very well and the software is very easy to use .####['laptop operation performance', 'software usability']
first , the factory default driver configuration of this thing is unstable , which makes installing a correct configuration more difficult .####['software operation performance']
if i had it to do over again , i would not buy this pc .####['laptop general']
i would * not * recommend this laptop .####['laptop general']
now , i have been stressed with fixing this laptop since every day has been something new that i need to fix with it .####['laptop operation performance']
the overall material the laptop is made of feels incredibly cheap .####['laptop design features']
the laptop was dead on arrival .####['laptop general']
it is not a very stable build at all .####['laptop design features']
i have had this laptop two months now and it has crashed as many times .####['laptop operation performance']
this is the worst laptop i have ever bought in my entire life .####['laptop general']
other than that its components are actually very good .####['laptop general']
the screen looks amazing , ips it seems .####['display design features']
it ' s light weight , sleek , the screen resolution is great and it runs very well for everyday use .####['display general', 'laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
moreover , the 8th gen i5 cpu is amazing .####['cpu general']
on it ' s own , it performance great !####['laptop operation performance']
love the form factor and the light weight as i often use my laptop while laying down .####['laptop design features']
less than that , for me , the screen looks dull .####['display quality']
if you ' re mainly on youtube or reading stuff online , this chromebook functions well for that purpose .####['laptop operation performance']
the laptop was shipped in what looked like a new case but upon opening it , it appeared used and repackaged .####['shipping quality']
looks like the hdmi port may be defective or something - - another reviewer had a similar problem .####['ports operation performance']
before the review this package has nice presentation and solid build .####['laptop quality', 'laptop design features']
( good ) as for the laptop ( when it worked , and i mean for the whole 30 minutes ) it was extremely fast .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
it ` ` feels ` ` solid .####['laptop quality']
having ram problems after 1 .####['hard disc general']
the wall power adapter charger is not working and then later caught fire .####['power supply operation performance']
i ' m extremely disappointed with the performance of this laptop .####['laptop operation performance']
there are several traps inside and outside of laptop .####['laptop general']
one of the keys is especially flimsy and feels like it could break at any moment .####['keyboard quality']
a big part of this device is its gorgeous aesthetic .####['laptop design features']
this is a great device and the $ 450 asking price seems fair .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
but it is a bit big and heavy .####['laptop design features']
it ' s sturdy , and looks and feels great .####['laptop design features']
love this chromebook !####['laptop general']
love the backlit keyboard .####['keyboard general']
at least the volume through bluetooth was tolerable .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
setup was fast and easy , but then again i ' ve been a gmail / gcal / gdocs purist for a while now .####['laptop usability']
it has exceeded my expectations for performance , functionality and utility .####['laptop operation performance']
this is my third chromebook and easily the best i ' ve encountered .####['laptop general']
very expensive for what you get .####['laptop price']
it ' s lighter , good construction , chromebook works perfectly and downloaded 10 different apps i normally use for free .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
nice screen .####['display general']
i love the keyboard , trackpad and screen .####['display general', 'keyboard general']
the speakers are super clear and get loud enough , but obviously lack bass .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
the build quality seems very good .####['laptop quality']
for ~ $ 400 , i ' m happy with this product after a couple months .####['laptop general']
it ' s fast and the screen is nice .####['display general', 'laptop operation performance']
i ' m four months into owning this lean , mean , little machine .####['laptop design features']
the best laptop i have ever owned .####['laptop general']
it works perfectly and feels very tight but it is something i noticed .####['laptop operation performance']
this is a very nice chromebook .####['laptop general']
cons : no usb ports .####['ports design features']
