overall , this thing can do very basic stuff , sometimes .####['laptop general']
i only use the chormebook for surving the internet , checking my email , and watch hulu or netflix .####['laptop general']
the flip and touchscreen aspects work fine , no problems .####['hardware operation performance']
it can not .####['laptop general']
good looking laptop but hardware has several major problems .####['hardware general', 'laptop design features']
6 - inch hd touch , intel celeron n3150 , 4gb ddr3l , 32gb , chrome , cb5 - 132t - c1lk####['memory general']
not worth it .####['laptop general']
delete and power button too close to each other and looks the same , i accidentally pressed the power button couple of times .####['keyboard design features', 'keyboard usability']
feel like at max brightness it just isn ' t enough .####['display operation performance']
no back light keyboard####['keyboard design features']
battery life is only 3 .####['battery operation performance']
- i swear my screen periodically changes brightness but i can ' t tell if this is my imagination or not .####['display operation performance']
- easily upgradeable hdd ( it comes with a 512 ssd , which is fine for now , but is easily changed out )####['hardware usability']
multiple ports for anything you need .####['ports general']
great laptop for expansion and upgrade .####['laptop design features']
this computer lives up to its expectations .####['laptop general']
was very easy to add memory .####['laptop usability']
i have been using a chromebook now for three years and am totally satisfied .####['laptop general']
my old chromebook is an acer and i ' ve had absolutely no problems with it .####['laptop general']
if i have a video call going on facebook messenger , chrome will take three or four seconds to respond .####['software operation performance']
great price - i always buy the warranty .####['warranty general', 'laptop price']
excellent for those uses .####['laptop usability']

laptop meets spec for what it was purchased to do but disappointed it was shipped with a charger not compatible with location it was shipped to ( needed to buy an adapter to convert from 2 pin to 3 pin plug )####['shipping general', 'laptop general']
has ac wireless so you can see the 5ghz on your network , blazing fast .####['ports operation performance']
i have had no issues with it since i bought it i would highly recommend it .####['laptop general']
the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####['os operation performance']
have had mine for about 3 - 4 wks and have had no trouble .####['laptop general']
if your main priority is a long lasting battery this is n ' t for you .####['battery general']
it is a very nice computer that serves his needs very well .####['laptop general']
it ' s also worth noting my unit came with a floating trackpad , with initial play before the actually click .####['display operation performance']
apparently there is some optimizations that google has done with the op1 and pixel that allow what is called instant ink .####['company operation performance']
horrible , purchased directly from google , dead pixel on arrival , note feature did not pick up stylus and bluetooth rarely worked .####['display quality', 'hardware general', 'laptop general', 'ports operation performance']
chrome os is not matured in any way .####['laptop general']
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####['os usability']
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .####['company general']
the mouse area is responsive , and has a nice feel to it .####['keyboard operation performance']
hope to continue to get many more years of use out of it !####['laptop general']
beautiful ips display .####['display design features']
the keyboard is good .####['keyboard general']
where they didn ' t sacrifice is on build quality .####['laptop quality']
i ' ve kept an eye on chromebooks for the last couple of years as a possible option for a low - cost laptop .####['laptop price']
this acer chromebook 14 is by far the best chromebook 300 dollars can buy .####['laptop price']
it is also very gnu + linux friendly if you want to replace the os entirely .####['laptop usability']
i could not be happier with this computer because i am not the best person with technology .####['laptop usability']
this acer is a web surfer that ' s easy to travel with .####['laptop usability']
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .####['keyboard general']
sure , another generation back was arguably better , but i find this computer to be adequate to my needs right now ( though it is a disappointment that i can ' t upgrade the ram , which definitely limits the lifetime of how long this product will last ) .####['laptop general']
the overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold .####['laptop design features']
and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .####['os usability']
i ' m probably a bit biased on macs since i ' m a professional graphic designer , and it ' s just the industry standard .####['laptop general']
it boots up instantaneously .####['laptop operation performance']
it is a small , light , powerful device that until 2016 seemed custom fit for content creators , photographers , and other such lines of work or hobbies .####['laptop design features']
well macbook is no less than expected .####['laptop general']
i love this laptop .####['laptop general']
i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !####['laptop general']
i ' ve only had it for one day and the set up was easy , and all items delivered were present , will update over time !####['os usability']
the display clarity is outstanding .####['display operation performance']
works exactly like it ' s supposed to work !####['laptop operation performance']
fast delivery , brand new as expected .####['shipping quality']
i was super worried that touching the keyboard when it was in tablet mode would cause it to switch back to laptop mode , but it looks like once you move the screen back past like 180 degrees , it goes into full touchscreen .####['keyboard usability']
my only complaint is the click on the touchpad feels a little cheap , but i just use ` ` tap to click ` ` so it ' s not an issue .####['hardware operation performance']
the power button is no longer on the keyboard , but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine .####['laptop design features']
transferring files from a non - iphone phone , like android is extremely annoying .####['software portability']
i made the mistake of thinking it was new .####['laptop general']
paradoxically , this laptop is a ` ` pro ` ` .####['laptop general']
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####['laptop quality', 'laptop general']
it charges insanely fast .####['power supply operation performance']
i ' ll end the review simply saying i ' m very happy overall with my purchase !####['laptop general']
great machine out of the box .####['laptop general']
the c302 is a great machine .####['laptop general']

vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####['software operation performance']
app game ( simpsons tapped out ) ( i know don ' t judge ) lags at every moment .####['software operation performance']
i love how i can charge my laptop on both sides of the device .####['laptop design features']
10 months in my battery will no longer charge .####['battery operation performance']
upon further inspection , i had noticed that one of the side speakers was pushed in and the plastic surrounding it had a crack .####['multimedia devices design features']
i just fear for the long term ruggedness of the exterior .####['hardware general']
it simply refuses to boot .####['laptop quality']
i ' ve never owned an msi laptop and if i can help it , this one is going back and i will never own one again .####['company general']
keyboard layout is not the best , do not like that i have to press the function key to raise or lower the volume / brightness on the arrow keys .####['keyboard design features']
so called msi tech support , went through the troubleshooting and of course they could not fix it .####['support general']
it ' s a very fast laptop .####['laptop operation performance']
it randomly shuts down all programs running and goes back to the desktop like nothing was going on .####['os operation performance']
this laptop is my first time using the intel optane thing and after this i can not recommend it .####['laptop general']
update review : having had this laptop for a few months it has had a bad crash from a recent windows update .####['laptop operation performance']
it ' s a good system and has loads of space available for storage :####['memory design features', 'os general']
all in all a great cheap gaming laptop that even with the cons i am not dissatisfied with the product .####['laptop general']
even using it a bit makes my hands / wrist uncomfortable .####['keyboard operation performance']
this happened 7 times within 20 minutes when i was working on something .####['laptop operation performance']
support got quite unpleasant when i ask about replacement .####['support quality']
the screen display isn ' t bright at all !####['display operation performance']
will not recommend it .####['laptop general']

it would not start up after 2 months of purchase and then re - set button didn ' t work .####['hardware general', 'laptop general']
after running through the setup wizard , the laptop failed to boot .####['laptop operation performance']
it ' s a good enough laptop .####['laptop general']
with my first day of use everything was terribly slow and updates took hours .####['laptop operation performance']
- android apps and google play store are real game changers for the chromeos landscape .####['software general']
d ) a bluetooth mouse - while this unarguably has one of the best trackpads in chromebook land , there are still times you just need the precision of a mouse .####['hardware general']
then the asus flip c302 came into my life :####['laptop general']
80 % of the apps it ' s a poor experience .####['software quality']
- excellent keyboard in all aspects - feel , rigidity , and backlight####['keyboard general']
surprisingly to me , the tablet form has been better than expected for reading .####['laptop operation performance']
