this unit is ` ` pretty ` ` and stylish , so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason .####['laptop design features']
for now i ' m okay with upping the experience & device to 3 out of 5 stars .####['laptop general']
this version has been my least favorite version i ' ve had for the following reasons listed bellow the pros .####['laptop general']
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####['hardware general']
should not of bought this chromebook .####['laptop general']
i can not stand the trackpad or the keyboard keys .####['keyboard general']
the chromebook r 11 was hardly used and only a few months old .####['laptop usability']
one day it just would not power up .####['battery operation performance']
some apps don ' t work but the play store is still in beta right now####['software general']
returning it after one day####['laptop general']
but do not dare will only be good for playing games maybe it will get better .####['laptop general']
asus customer support was through chat and cumbersome .####['support general']
the screen is very dim however .####['display operation performance']
don ' t buy this machine .####['laptop general']
sounds like a good deal for a $ 620 laptop but battery doesn ' t perform as promised i am hardly getting 4 hrs .####['battery operation performance', 'laptop price']
screen is good .####['display general']
keyboard is decent with good travel .####['keyboard portability']
thin bezels allow for a compact frame####['laptop design features']
overall this is a good system for the price and i do recommend the ssd for the price .####['os price', 'hard disc price']
but my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises , both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk .####['fans&cooling operation performance']
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####['company general', 'laptop general']
if you can save for 750 - 800 i would recommend going up a bit in the asus line .####['company general']
it seems like there is a problem with the processor because it constantly starts and stops while i ' m trying to surf the web .####['cpu general']
pros : lightweight and looks nice .####['laptop portability', 'laptop general']
this computer is loud !####['laptop design features']
returned because had it less than a month and it decided to go crazy and start typing by its self ect .####['laptop operation performance']
this computer has wasted so much of my time already .####['laptop general']
it still is nice looking with a textured cover and being black overall .####['laptop design features']
it opens programs immediately .####['os operation performance']
i do not think i will need to upgrade the ram .####['memory general']
acer made a winner here !####['laptop general']
buy this computer and you ' ll be very happy with it .####['laptop price']
+ backlight kb and travel feels pretty nice on the keys .####['keyboard operation performance']
- an optical drive if you ever want to play a classic game or watch a dvd .####['optical drives general']
the ports were another thing that i was really excited to see fully included on a laptop in this price range .####['laptop price', 'ports general']
i ' ve been happy being able to plug in and run overwatch from time to time on this laptop , with higher settings .####['laptop design features']
this is the best laptop for the price .####['laptop price']
i like that it ' s got the 8th generation i5 cpu .####['cpu general']
dedicated graphics card####['graphics general']
the picture clarity is amazing and the backlit keyboard is awesome .####['display quality', 'keyboard design features']
also love that access to the hd / ssd and ram slots is really easy .####['memory design features']
acer seems to be the only one who puts together stuff like this .####['laptop general']
the bluetooth connects easily to everything .####['multimedia devices connectivity']
it boots in seconds although i usually just leave it on constantly .####['laptop operation performance']
- the battery life is excellent ( i get 6 - 8 hours of normal university student usage out of it ) and even when i ' m using it , it charges as fast as my phone .####['battery operation performance']
however , other than video calls it does really well .####['laptop general']
the chromebook has instant connection and a hugely impressive 8 - hour battery life when left on .####['battery operation performance', 'laptop connectivity']
i just got it today and i love it !####['laptop general']
works great !####['laptop general']
he loves it .####['laptop general']
a great chromebook at a very reasonable price , includes the google play store .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
that being said , my son loves it .####['laptop general']
great computer and great value , our second chromebook and first one still doing fine just needed another for family .####['laptop general']
set up is take out of box and open cover .####['laptop usability']
works great .####['laptop operation performance']
i loved mine , so i got her the same one .####['laptop general']
can ' t really find a viewing angle where all of it looks right at the same time .####['display operation performance']
very easy to set up .####['laptop usability']
the chromebook was packaged well and we saw no defects ( ours was used ) .####['shipping quality']
it is a basic little laptop and i love it .####['laptop general']
there is a lot of ' bang for your buck ' in the lenovo ideapad 320 .####['laptop general']
my only fair complaint is that it occasionally restarts itself without warning ( usually no more than once every day or two ) .####['laptop operation performance']
a good product !####['laptop general']
light thin best price power laptop####['laptop design features', 'laptop price']
love this so much !####['laptop general']
overall , this was a good buy and i still love my purchase nonetheless .####['laptop general']
i ' m using it mainly to store movies , and the 1 tb drive is nice .####['hard disc general']
nice keyboard .####['keyboard general']
i have always loved loved the kindles .####['laptop general']
my only complaint is that the mouse keypad is a little big .####['mouse design features']
so , i have had this laptop for almost a week and have put it through the ringer .####['laptop general']
only thing i really didn ' t like about this was how quickly the battery drained .####['battery operation performance']
i have n ' t used it much for gaming but i imagine it works fine .####['laptop operation performance']
if you ' re big on aesthetics then you ' ll love the look .####['laptop design features']
i will never use another microsoft program as long as i live .####['software general']
just a home pc laptop that works very well .####['laptop operation performance']
it has a full size keyboard , a number pad , a camera , and great big screen !####['display design features', 'keyboard design features']
this is just perfect .####['laptop general']
very happy with this laptop although not a fan of windows 10 .####['os general', 'laptop general']
navigates well .####['out of scope general']
using it for doing programming , app development , and electronics projects .####['laptop general']
so far i ' m enjoying it .####['laptop general']
it is very good for the price .####['laptop price']
it keep going off on sleep mode without any way to wake it up .####['laptop operation performance']
which is really sad because in the time i could actually use the chromebook i absolutely loved it .####['laptop general']
i tried it , and it is very limited for the current price of $ 550 .####['laptop operation performance']
many apps aren ' t ` ` compatible ` ` and even the ones that work , they look awful .####['software operation performance']
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop quality', 'display general']
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####['laptop price']
for home users , these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two - screening , to watching videos and calling family .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop price']
as a 5 - year chromebook veteran , i ' ve been waiting for this machine .####['laptop general']
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####['cpu operation performance', 'cpu price']
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####['laptop quality']
i also don ' t want the power cord draped down the right side and annoying me .####['power supply design features']
i was pleasantly surprised at how good it is .####['laptop general']
as a windows and mac user , i wasn ' t sure if i could benefit from using chromeos , but i find myself using it more than i anticipated .####['os general']
i was extremely hesitant to buy a used macbook pro ( it ' s still a lot of money ) but so far am surprisingly pleased with it .####['laptop general']
- new ports that were not in the 2011 model : hdmi port , extra thunderbolt video port ( now it has two instead of one )####['ports general']
i had the chance to test the new radeon graphics card and it ' s really good .####['graphics general']
honestly , i think nobody uses these ports anyway .####['ports general']
maybe that ' s a consequence of how the retina display is built , but yeah , it ' s harder to keep the screen clean .####['display general']
these macbook pro computers are expensive .####['laptop price']
i think for others they are just buying into the brand .####['company general']
i love the retina display .####['display general']
i am extremely happy with this laptop .####['laptop general']
it worked perfectly right out of the box .####['laptop operation performance']
great product !####['laptop general']
battery issues aside , i really love this laptop and it is easily the nicest piece of electronics i have ever owned .####['battery general', 'laptop general']
neat and sleek build , great display and very nice os####['laptop design features', 'os general', 'display general']
the new touchpad takes a little getting used to , but otherwise it ' s been perfect .####['keyboard general', 'laptop general']
the retina screen is amazing .####['display operation performance']
less of a fault of the much lauded diving board and more a factor of the very well designed new hardware .####['hardware design features']
not to mention , the touchbar is just another gimmicky addition to the ` ` future of apple ` ` ( really not as effective as one would think ) .####['keyboard general']
battery life is a huge plus !####['battery operation performance']
such a nice mac####['laptop general']
price was very good and met my expectations also shipping was very quick .####['laptop price', 'shipping general']
however , i have to remove one star for the very unreliable magnetic charging connector .####['power supply design features']
my first mac is awesome !####['laptop general']
it arrived on time and in excellent condition and my hubby has been happily using it now for several weeks with no problems .####['shipping general', 'laptop general']
this laptop has all the necessary ports .####['laptop design features']
as i bought 13 inch model , it is very portable .####['laptop portability']
i ' ve been extremely impressed by this device .####['laptop general']
it feels responsive to me , and i went to settings to customize the speed , clicking , and scrolling .####['hardware operation performance']
the only drawback is that it only comes with 32 gb of hard drive .####['hard disc design features']
configuring the printer was a little tricky but not bad .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
my desktop runs all my video editing software for my bigger and most demanding projects and mylaptop is great for editing video and running pc games in places other than my home ( like school ! )####['laptop miscellaneous']
either they were so slow i couldn ' t get any work done or they just flat out broke after a couple months .####['laptop operation performance']
this is where the r11 gets interesting .####['laptop usability']
i have not had any freezing or screen flashing issues .####['display operation performance']
did i mention , i can access all my word , excel , and powerpoint files using the google apps .####['software usability']
i have had it about 4 days and have been checking out how well it runs my favorite android apps .####['laptop operation performance', 'software operation performance']
unfortunately , this particular computer is 100 % unusable after only 2 years and 2 weeks .####['laptop usability']
it is a timeless design and a very respectable screen .####['laptop design features', 'display general']
i ' m disappointed with macbook pro 15 ” because sometimes charger macbook pro 15 ” running overheating !####['power supply operation performance', 'laptop general']
* extremely weak graphics card .####['graphics operation performance']
the intel iris sucks .####['hard disc operation performance']
i can ' t use my printer because it ' s not supported .####['ports usability']
usb port go dead until i do a restart .####['ports operation performance']
now i ' m just down to some gripes that are probably here to stay : the bluetooth on this thing is really fussy , the non - functional video output ( using usb - c video out through an hdmi cable sends just a blank desktop background and no audio , even if i am playing a movie or youtube visibly on the c302 screen ) , and that it can ' t hold a vpn connection without dropping it every 20 - 30 minutes .####['laptop connectivity', 'hardware operation performance']
sometimes they felt a bit half - baked , but i loved the idea , and the keyboard made a world of difference in what you could do with that tablet .####['keyboard general', 'laptop general']
- good screen .####['display general']
the funny part is that the customer service people have been great but they have no control to take care of problems .####['support general']
all metal body , very slim form factor , and has a pretty decent touchscreen .####['laptop design features', 'display general']
as others have already reported , the headphone jack produces extremely weak volume , even at max .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
anyhow , within a week , the speakers started crackling annoyingly when watching videos , or playing games .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
unlike other asus laptops i ' ve tried , this unit won the display roulette .####['laptop design features']
the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####['software operation performance']
if i had it to do over , i would not purchase this computer .####['laptop general']
the first issue is that the speakers are on either side of the computer , and you can barely hear them on max volume .####['multimedia devices design features']
it also had charging problems and got terrible warranty support .####['power supply general', 'warranty general']
i got the same failure to charge issue that others have reported .####['power supply general']
if bluetooth devices worked with this chromebook it would get 5 stars , but this is the least reliable device in regards to bluetooth i have ever owned .####['laptop general']
i feel like i bought a decent machine but it ' s unable to handle the ram workload .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
i don ' t think that i was adequately prepared for how dark the screen is at its highest brightness in comparison to other devices .####['display design features']
don ' t get me wrong , the device flips back and forth very well .####['laptop design features']
was initially impressed by design but after normal use without any rough handling or dropping of the chromebook , the metal corner tip covering the lcd peels off & warps / bends upwards !####['hardware quality']
this computer is really hard to use .####['laptop usability']
it ' s their policy to only repair not replace .####['support quality']
other than this , it ' s a decent product .####['laptop general']
the machine ' s visible design itself was fine .####['laptop design features']
after one charge , the battery would not take charge .####['battery operation performance']
it will not power on anymore after 2 mos of daily use - 4 hours per day .####['laptop operation performance']
i went through two of them , both came with sharp edges that made them dangerous and uncomfortable to use .####['laptop design features']
i really liked it when i first got it , it performs very well and the software is very easy to use .####['laptop operation performance', 'software usability']
using wifi the signal seems to drop , not sure if the wifi adapter needs an update but there are issues .####['software operation performance', 'out of scope operation performance']
first , the factory default driver configuration of this thing is unstable , which makes installing a correct configuration more difficult .####['software operation performance']
the mouse pad is very touchy , but i use a separate bluetooth mouse anyways .####['hardware operation performance']
i didn ' t even call for tech help because a brand new laptop should not be giving me such a headache .####['laptop general']
monitor screen is ok , sometimes the contrast is poor but looks better in games .####['display operation performance']
the laptop now does n ' t even function without needing a full factory reset every 3 hours .####['laptop operation performance']
if i had it to do over again , i would not buy this pc .####['laptop general']
i would * not * recommend this laptop .####['laptop general']
now , i have been stressed with fixing this laptop since every day has been something new that i need to fix with it .####['laptop operation performance']
the overall material the laptop is made of feels incredibly cheap .####['laptop design features']
don ' t waste your money on this computer , it will disapoint you in every way possible .####['laptop general']
the laptop was dead on arrival .####['laptop general']
it is not a very stable build at all .####['laptop design features']
i have had this laptop two months now and it has crashed as many times .####['laptop operation performance']
this is the worst laptop i have ever bought in my entire life .####['laptop general']
battery charger is super tiny and lightweight , which is an additional advantage vs the 1 lb brick that you have to lug around with the ux501vw .####['power supply design features']
other than that its components are actually very good .####['laptop general']
the screen looks amazing , ips it seems .####['display design features']
loving the laptop .####['laptop general']
it ' s light weight , sleek , the screen resolution is great and it runs very well for everyday use .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features', 'display general']
it charges very fast ; from near dead to full in less than an hour .####['power supply operation performance']
i got this laptop for school and it is simply amazing .####['laptop general']
moreover , the 8th gen i5 cpu is amazing .####['cpu general']
this has been a very light convenient laptop for me .####['laptop design features', 'laptop usability']
i have no issues with using the internal hard drive , it works fast enough for me when loading up my software and music .####['hard disc operation performance']
i ' m not a computer nerd but for a joe punch clock this is nice####['laptop general']
on it ' s own , it performance great !####['laptop operation performance']
love the form factor and the light weight as i often use my laptop while laying down .####['laptop design features']
opening it was a little hard but once opened , it ' s easy to add the ram or ssd .####['laptop design features']
less than that , for me , the screen looks dull .####['display quality']
if you ' re mainly on youtube or reading stuff online , this chromebook functions well for that purpose .####['laptop operation performance']
the laptop was shipped in what looked like a new case but upon opening it , it appeared used and repackaged .####['shipping quality']
looks like the hdmi port may be defective or something - - another reviewer had a similar problem .####['ports operation performance']
before the review this package has nice presentation and solid build .####['laptop design features', 'laptop quality']
( good ) as for the laptop ( when it worked , and i mean for the whole 30 minutes ) it was extremely fast .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
adequate screen .####['display general']
it ` ` feels ` ` solid .####['laptop quality']
the product looks reasonable at this price range .####['laptop price']
i ' ve only had the computer for a little over a month , that is annoying on many levels .####['laptop general']
having ram problems after 1 .####['hard disc general']
i ' ve been able to play fortnite on this laptop , medium settings , with no issues or lag / stutter .####['laptop operation performance']
unfortunately i was never able to complete this task , because after booting the laptop it suddenly shut - off on me and wouldn ' t turn back on again .####['laptop operation performance']
the wall power adapter charger is not working and then later caught fire .####['power supply operation performance']
i ' m extremely disappointed with the performance of this laptop .####['laptop operation performance']
there are several traps inside and outside of laptop .####['laptop general']
- sleek and nice texture on lid####['laptop design features']
one of the keys is especially flimsy and feels like it could break at any moment .####['keyboard quality']
it gets what you need done .####['laptop operation performance']
if you plan on buying this beware that your patience may run thin .####['laptop general']
machine is totally unusable during the update .####['laptop operation performance']
i received the item after 18 days of ordering .####['shipping general']
gamers , do not fool yourself with the fancy ` ` intel i5 , 8th generation ` ` , nothing can fix an incompetent hard drive , that 8gb ram is worth nothing .####['memory general', 'hard disc operation performance', 'cpu general']
asus has really set a new standard with the c302ca ' s internals and physical design .####['laptop design features', 'company design features']
similarly the task tray area of the main task bar is on the small side and lends itself to fat - fingering .####['software design features']
a big part of this device is its gorgeous aesthetic .####['laptop design features']
this is a great device and the $ 450 asking price seems fair .####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
this computer was 10 fold what i had expected .####['laptop general']
i ' m usually peaked with ram ( ~ 95 % ) which is good because it ' s better used than not used .####['memory operation performance']
but it is a bit big and heavy .####['laptop design features']
quality is excellent so far , and the software / hardware combination works like they were made for each other ( which is what you want : ) )####['laptop quality', 'hardware operation performance', 'software operation performance']
after a week of use , i can safely say it is the most impressive chromebook i have used to - date .####['laptop general']
it ' s sturdy , and looks and feels great .####['laptop design features']
love this chromebook !####['laptop general']
love the backlit keyboard .####['keyboard general']
at least the volume through bluetooth was tolerable .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
after two years , or almost , the worst thing about this machine is lack of printer support .####['laptop design features']
setup was fast and easy , but then again i ' ve been a gmail / gcal / gdocs purist for a while now .####['laptop usability']
it has exceeded my expectations for performance , functionality and utility .####['laptop operation performance']
in general , it has the look and feel of a premium laptop that is at home in any situation such as sitting down with a client .####['laptop design features']
battery life is outstanding .####['battery general']
this is my third chromebook and easily the best i ' ve encountered .####['laptop general']
very expensive for what you get .####['laptop price']
it ' s lighter , good construction , chromebook works perfectly and downloaded 10 different apps i normally use for free .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
battery life is also solid .####['battery operation performance']
construction looks and feels great .####['laptop design features']
nice screen .####['display general']
i am a mac person in every other way , but i love this chromebook !####['laptop general']
easy set up , nice picture , responsive mouse pad , very lightweight , etc .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features', 'keyboard operation performance']
i love the keyboard , trackpad and screen .####['keyboard general', 'display general']
the speakers are super clear and get loud enough , but obviously lack bass .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
the build quality seems very good .####['laptop quality']
for ~ $ 400 , i ' m happy with this product after a couple months .####['laptop general']
it ' s fast and the screen is nice .####['laptop operation performance', 'display general']
overall i like its slim design and feather light - weight alone with well equipped spec that can meet my daily work environment .####['laptop design features']
i ' m four months into owning this lean , mean , little machine .####['laptop design features']
i ' ve already recommended or bought this for 4 others .####['laptop general']
the best laptop i have ever owned .####['laptop general']
this chromebook looks and feels great , performs even better and will soon support google play apps .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
it works perfectly and feels very tight but it is something i noticed .####['laptop operation performance']
this is a very nice chromebook .####['laptop general']
this is my second asus product , and i have been very happy with both .####['laptop general']
cons : no usb ports .####['ports design features']
