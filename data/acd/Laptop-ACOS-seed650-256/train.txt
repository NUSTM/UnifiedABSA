keyboard key fragile .####['keyboard quality']
i only use the chormebook for surving the internet , checking my email , and watch hulu or netflix .####['laptop general']
the flip and touchscreen aspects work fine , no problems .####['hardware operation performance']

good looking laptop but hardware has several major problems .####['hardware general', 'laptop design features']
i ' ve called twice to try to connect it to printer , first call they told me i had to get a cloud ready printer after getting said printer it still doesn ' t connect .####['laptop connectivity']

it appears the adapter may still be good as there are a few sparks when plugging into power but the charging light on the laptop does not come on and the battery is not charging .####['hardware operation performance', 'battery operation performance', 'hardware quality', 'power supply operation performance', 'battery quality']
not worth it .####['laptop general']
delete and power button too close to each other and looks the same , i accidentally pressed the power button couple of times .####['keyboard design features', 'keyboard usability']
on day one , i had been using it for maybe 2 hours and it randomly shut off .####['laptop operation performance']
feel like at max brightness it just isn ' t enough .####['display operation performance']
i ' m amazed how bad this machine is for the money , and for being described as a ` ` mid - level gamer . ` `####['laptop price', 'laptop general']
no back light keyboard####['keyboard design features']
not only is it light the battery charger is tiny and with the thin bezels this is a super compact design .####['power supply design features', 'laptop design features', 'laptop portability']
the speakers are also not great and the max volume on watching netflix or other videos is rather quite .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
the laptop does n ' t work .####['laptop quality']
battery life is only 3 .####['battery operation performance']

- i swear my screen periodically changes brightness but i can ' t tell if this is my imagination or not .####['display operation performance']

multiple ports for anything you need .####['ports general']
it cost 8 dollars and shipping is not cheap .####['shipping price']

the best laptop for its price .####['laptop price']
lenovo computers are of chinese manufacture and thus you will not know if yours is one of the pla ' s cyber - spies .####['company general']
this is a great laptop for web browsing , skype , and more simple games .####['laptop operation performance']
i love the fact that it can extend and be flat .####['laptop design features']
lenovo paid for my shipping to the repair facility since i ' d had it such a short time , and they fixed and returned it in a reasonable time period .####['support operation performance']
it works like it is made to run linux .####['laptop operation performance']
laptop meets spec for what it was purchased to do but disappointed it was shipped with a charger not compatible with location it was shipped to ( needed to buy an adapter to convert from 2 pin to 3 pin plug )####['shipping general', 'laptop general']
has ac wireless so you can see the 5ghz on your network , blazing fast .####['ports operation performance']
great laptop if you are willing to put in an ssd and reinstall windows .####['laptop general']
it is very easy to use the set up was awesome .####['software usability']

the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####['os operation performance']

if your main priority is a long lasting battery this is n ' t for you .####['battery general']
it is a very nice computer that serves his needs very well .####['laptop general']
it ' s not real fast and it doesn ' t have a lot of storage .####['laptop operation performance', 'hard disc general']
i enjoy that it has 10 key .####['laptop design features']
very good purchase .####['laptop general']
great laptop , very quick and efficient for work and casual gaming , got over 200 fps for steam games .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop general']
the solution i am trying for now is to disable the touch screen .####['display quality']
i ' m surprised people are settling for claiming ` ` it ' s good enough ` ` or ` ` gets the job done ` ` when every time i use it , i ' m constantly reminded of how i should have just sprang for the pixelbook when it was on sale for $ 699 .####['laptop price']
it ' s also worth noting my unit came with a floating trackpad , with initial play before the actually click .####['display operation performance']
it is very limited and the competition for an actual usable operating system that can do a lot more than just browse the internet , are available .####['laptop operation performance', 'os operation performance']
the problem is that it never charged .####['laptop operation performance']
apparently there is some optimizations that google has done with the op1 and pixel that allow what is called instant ink .####['company operation performance']
horrible , purchased directly from google , dead pixel on arrival , note feature did not pick up stylus and bluetooth rarely worked .####['display quality', 'hardware general', 'ports operation performance', 'laptop general']
chrome os is not matured in any way .####['laptop general']
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####['os usability']
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .####['company general']
the hardware specs on this are very nice compared to other offerings : 4g ram , 32g storage , quad - core processor , etc .####['hardware general']
the mouse area is responsive , and has a nice feel to it .####['keyboard operation performance']
hope to continue to get many more years of use out of it !####['laptop general']
it take a bit of getting used to .####['keyboard usability']
beautiful ips display .####['display design features']
now it kind of feels a little bit like windows but still different .####['os design features']
the keyboard is good .####['keyboard general']
but the 4 gb of ram makes the things you use a chromebook for work without delay .####['memory operation performance']
where they didn ' t sacrifice is on build quality .####['laptop quality']
i ' ve kept an eye on chromebooks for the last couple of years as a possible option for a low - cost laptop .####['laptop price']
this acer chromebook 14 is by far the best chromebook 300 dollars can buy .####['laptop price']
it is also very gnu + linux friendly if you want to replace the os entirely .####['laptop usability']
i could not be happier with this computer because i am not the best person with technology .####['laptop usability']
first time users might have a hard time using the keyboard ( some keys like caps lock , pagedown , pageup , delete , home etc are missing , browse the internet to get the equivalent ones ) .####['keyboard design features']
this acer is a web surfer that ' s easy to travel with .####['laptop usability']
i purchased this item 7 months ago and i love it .####['laptop general']
with real function keys , i don ' t worry about one vendor or another not upgrading fast enough and losing virtual function keys , so this model is golden .####['laptop general']
- the computer is 1 pound ( approx .####['laptop design features']
battery life : i haven ' t had the laptop for too long but easily get 8 hours or more on a charge .####['battery general']
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .####['keyboard general']
sure , another generation back was arguably better , but i find this computer to be adequate to my needs right now ( though it is a disappointment that i can ' t upgrade the ram , which definitely limits the lifetime of how long this product will last ) .####['laptop general']
the overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold .####['laptop design features']
and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .####['os usability']
i ' m probably a bit biased on macs since i ' m a professional graphic designer , and it ' s just the industry standard .####['laptop general']
fantastic computer !####['laptop general']
the mbp does not run as hot as my old white mb did .####['laptop quality']
but the mac looked and worked great .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
it boots up instantaneously .####['laptop operation performance']
it is a small , light , powerful device that until 2016 seemed custom fit for content creators , photographers , and other such lines of work or hobbies .####['laptop design features']
the new retina is amazing and the speed is awesome .####['display operation performance', 'cpu operation performance']
well macbook is no less than expected .####['laptop general']
i love this laptop .####['laptop general']
now i keep seeing headlines for bad battery life and other woes for the 2016 edition and feel extra satisfied by my choice .####['battery quality']
i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !####['laptop general']

the display clarity is outstanding .####['display operation performance']
works exactly like it ' s supposed to work !####['laptop operation performance']
fast delivery , brand new as expected .####['shipping quality']
i was super worried that touching the keyboard when it was in tablet mode would cause it to switch back to laptop mode , but it looks like once you move the screen back past like 180 degrees , it goes into full touchscreen .####['keyboard usability']
i ' ve used it for 3 days and still have n ' t plugged it in !####['battery quality']
my only complaint is the click on the touchpad feels a little cheap , but i just use ` ` tap to click ` ` so it ' s not an issue .####['hardware operation performance']
yes , this chromebook comes with the android app store pre - installed .####['laptop design features']
the power button is no longer on the keyboard , but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine .####['laptop design features']
it is fast and simple .####['laptop operation performance']
this model has a defect .####['laptop design features']
as soon as i turned on the computer , it froze as i tried to sync information .####['laptop operation performance']
have not heard any complaints about the product .####['laptop general']
it turns out that it ' s not a stain , but the anti - reflective coating coming off .####['laptop quality']
transferring files from a non - iphone phone , like android is extremely annoying .####['software portability']
i made the mistake of thinking it was new .####['laptop general']
it would power on , start to boot , then abruptly power down .####['laptop operation performance']
paradoxically , this laptop is a ` ` pro ` ` .####['laptop general']
this is a great computer .####['laptop general']
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####['laptop quality', 'laptop general']
i will update this review when there is further progress - i believe this is a 5 star product but the updates are reducing my confidence in the software .####['software general', 'laptop general']
it charges insanely fast .####['power supply operation performance']
i ' ll end the review simply saying i ' m very happy overall with my purchase !####['laptop general']
great machine out of the box .####['laptop general']
the c302 is a great machine .####['laptop general']
i ' ve had mine 10 months and the motherboard has crapped out twice already .####['motherboard operation performance']
my disappointment begins with the fact that chromeos is not touch - ready and most websites will not consider touch interface for desktop mode websites .####['os usability']
• super thin and light weight####['laptop design features']
i would look elsewhere for a convertible chrombook , this one just doesn ' t quite live up expectactions .####['laptop general']
vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####['software operation performance']
many apps won ' t download and work on it like they do on an ellipsis .####['software operation performance']
the one star is for warranty support .####['support general']
netflix and hulu seem to be working for the most part so far , but amazon prime and xfinity stream are both having issues .####['software operation performance']
the computer is great , but the charger is garbage .####['power supply general', 'laptop general']
app game ( simpsons tapped out ) ( i know don ' t judge ) lags at every moment .####['software operation performance']
the chromebook seems to be working fine now and my daughter does love it .####['laptop general']
moreover i ' m quite upset because it seems amazon will not pay me back the shipping fees , which for me amount to about 100 $ as i live in france .####['shipping general']
i love how i can charge my laptop on both sides of the device .####['laptop design features']
i much suspect that google ' s half baked sustem is at fault .####['os general']
10 months in my battery will no longer charge .####['battery operation performance']
this product is built well , but it won ' t run the one android app i hoped it would run , and for whatever reason the app and os update download speeds are abysmal .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
upon further inspection , i had noticed that one of the side speakers was pushed in and the plastic surrounding it had a crack .####['multimedia devices design features']
only three months in , and the laptop won ' t charge .####['laptop operation performance']
i loved this chromebook but i had to return it bevause it had sound issues .####['multimedia devices operation performance', 'laptop general']
i just fear for the long term ruggedness of the exterior .####['hardware general']
the screen is good , the tablet mode is nice , and the keyboard has a good feel .####['keyboard design features', 'display general', 'laptop general']
this is the worst computer i have ever owned .####['laptop general']
it simply refuses to boot .####['laptop quality']
i ' ve never owned an msi laptop and if i can help it , this one is going back and i will never own one again .####['company general']
however , i tried to power it up today and kept receiving an error message right at startup that was a ` ` system boot violation ` ` .####['laptop operation performance']
keyboard layout is not the best , do not like that i have to press the function key to raise or lower the volume / brightness on the arrow keys .####['keyboard design features']
in essence , if you want a gaming pc , this one will do the job .####['laptop general']
everything about the experience has been terrible .####['laptop general']
the last straw happened recently when i put it to sleep and it just wouldn ' t wake up - or rather it would try , and then spend the next several hours in a repair / analyzing mode that didn ' t actually do anything .####['laptop operation performance']
do not buy this computer !####['laptop general']
multiple system crashes .####['os operation performance']
so called msi tech support , went through the troubleshooting and of course they could not fix it .####['support general']
it ' s a very fast laptop .####['laptop operation performance']
it randomly shuts down all programs running and goes back to the desktop like nothing was going on .####['os operation performance']
this laptop is my first time using the intel optane thing and after this i can not recommend it .####['laptop general']
to bad the battery did n ' t work out .####['battery operation performance']

it is fast and lightweight .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop design features']
it ' s a good system and has loads of space available for storage :####['os general', 'memory design features']
all in all a great cheap gaming laptop that even with the cons i am not dissatisfied with the product .####['laptop general']
awesome computer .####['laptop general']
well , wifi worked instantly without bugs .####['ports operation performance']
after that , it ' s actually been running well .####['laptop operation performance']
most of the time it works very well and one is subject to the vagaries of the various apps , browser , etc .####['laptop operation performance']
even using it a bit makes my hands / wrist uncomfortable .####['keyboard operation performance']
this happened 7 times within 20 minutes when i was working on something .####['laptop operation performance']
support got quite unpleasant when i ask about replacement .####['support quality']
very good build quality , except for the keyboard apparently , sound was very big , very fast boot times and so much more .####['multimedia devices operation performance', 'laptop quality', 'os operation performance', 'keyboard quality']
the screen display isn ' t bright at all !####['display operation performance']
update - this thing frustrated me so much over the past month that i just threw it in the trash ( where it belongs ) .####['laptop general']
will not recommend it .####['laptop general']
my computer was used on average a couple hours a day .####['laptop general']
laptop failed after only six months of use .####['laptop quality']
worked fine until 3 months after i bought it .####['laptop general']
it would not start up after 2 months of purchase and then re - set button didn ' t work .####['hardware general', 'laptop general']
its a good computer for the price but it needs to work awhile without crashing within 6 months .####['laptop price']
it works well , but the only thing i don ' t like about it is that it makes it extremely difficult to find things that i ' m looking for .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop usability']
barely have it for 6 months and everything ' s going haywire .####['laptop general']
this is a painfully slow computer .####['laptop operation performance']
after running through the setup wizard , the laptop failed to boot .####['laptop operation performance']
it ' s a good enough laptop .####['laptop general']
with my first day of use everything was terribly slow and updates took hours .####['laptop operation performance']
2 stars taken for horrible sound quality####['multimedia devices quality']
the only issue i ' m having is battery life .####['battery operation performance']
it has a glassy - smooth surface that resists finger - prints and goop , is very large , and has a firm but not too - clunky feeling click to it .####['display design features']
- android apps and google play store are real game changers for the chromeos landscape .####['software general']
- system settings could be more robust and better organized####['os design features']
d ) a bluetooth mouse - while this unarguably has one of the best trackpads in chromebook land , there are still times you just need the precision of a mouse .####['hardware general']
then the asus flip c302 came into my life :####['laptop general']
80 % of the apps it ' s a poor experience .####['software quality']
and because of the constant usage of higher brightness , the battery does drain faster .####['battery operation performance']
one , the display is gorgeous ; watching video is a treat .####['display operation performance']
the speakers get plenty loud , but they start to sound pretty bad when turned up a little past half volume .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
- excellent keyboard in all aspects - feel , rigidity , and backlight####['keyboard general']
- the build quality is great but not necessarily impressive .####['laptop quality']
i wish the display was able to go about 1 or 2 clicks brighter and about 1 click darker at the lowest setting .####['display design features']
surprisingly to me , the tablet form has been better than expected for reading .####['laptop operation performance']
bluetooth to an external speaker is do - able , but not convenient .####['multimedia devices connectivity']
love the keyboard more than its predecessor .####['keyboard general']
i don ' t know that i would want to use for work but it ' s perfect for personal use .####['laptop general']
the keyboard is really nice - .####['keyboard general']
this chromebook is great system that is lightweight , has excellent battery life , and offers a fantastic keyboard .####['keyboard general', 'laptop design features', 'battery general', 'laptop general']

i ' m more about personality than looks , but this little thing is a looker , too .####['laptop design features']
touch screen is really responsive .####['display operation performance']
everything works fast and smooth .####['laptop operation performance']
bought this because of the touch screen and specs capable of running android ( and it ' s a supported model ) .####['laptop design features']
the touchscreen works well , the apps generally work , the performance is good .####['display operation performance', 'software operation performance']
i work with an it company and we ' re testing an all android environment and it ' s working out pretty well so far .####['software operation performance']
the computer itself is sturdy and feels well - made , though the keyboard is a bit smaller than i ' m used to .####['laptop design features', 'keyboard design features']
battery life is good .####['battery general']
battery life is fantastic giving me over 8 hours easily with moderate usage .####['battery operation performance']
i ' ve been happy with all of the asus devices i ' ve purchased ( several computers and tablets ) but this is a real gem .####['laptop general']
the touchscreen is great though and feels very intuitive .####['display general']
- battery life is a bit short after some gaming####['battery operation performance']
- touch pad seems a little off to me .####['hardware operation performance']
i find it to be a little large when used in tablet mode .####['laptop design features']
so far i absolutely love it .####['laptop general']
it greatly exceeded my expectations .####['laptop general']
pro ' s : this chromebook is very light .####['laptop design features']
i like it , good construction , can load android apps .####['laptop design features']
its really quick at loading web pages .####['laptop operation performance']
a great chromebook .####['laptop general']
i use this for work , school , and to just watch videos or read books !####['laptop general']

i think the sound could be better .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
