the flip and touchscreen aspects work fine , no problems .####['hardware operation performance']
it can not .####['laptop general']
6 - inch hd touch , intel celeron n3150 , 4gb ddr3l , 32gb , chrome , cb5 - 132t - c1lk####['memory general']
not worth it .####['laptop general']
no back light keyboard####['keyboard design features']
- i swear my screen periodically changes brightness but i can ' t tell if this is my imagination or not .####['display operation performance']
- easily upgradeable hdd ( it comes with a 512 ssd , which is fine for now , but is easily changed out )####['hardware usability']
great laptop for expansion and upgrade .####['laptop design features']

laptop meets spec for what it was purchased to do but disappointed it was shipped with a charger not compatible with location it was shipped to ( needed to buy an adapter to convert from 2 pin to 3 pin plug )####['shipping general', 'laptop general']
has ac wireless so you can see the 5ghz on your network , blazing fast .####['ports operation performance']
i have had no issues with it since i bought it i would highly recommend it .####['laptop general']

if your main priority is a long lasting battery this is n ' t for you .####['battery general']
apparently there is some optimizations that google has done with the op1 and pixel that allow what is called instant ink .####['company operation performance']
horrible , purchased directly from google , dead pixel on arrival , note feature did not pick up stylus and bluetooth rarely worked .####['display quality', 'hardware general', 'laptop general', 'ports operation performance']
chrome os is not matured in any way .####['laptop general']
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .####['company general']
where they didn ' t sacrifice is on build quality .####['laptop quality']
i ' ve kept an eye on chromebooks for the last couple of years as a possible option for a low - cost laptop .####['laptop price']
this acer chromebook 14 is by far the best chromebook 300 dollars can buy .####['laptop price']
it is also very gnu + linux friendly if you want to replace the os entirely .####['laptop usability']
sure , another generation back was arguably better , but i find this computer to be adequate to my needs right now ( though it is a disappointment that i can ' t upgrade the ram , which definitely limits the lifetime of how long this product will last ) .####['laptop general']
the overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold .####['laptop design features']
and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .####['os usability']
it is a small , light , powerful device that until 2016 seemed custom fit for content creators , photographers , and other such lines of work or hobbies .####['laptop design features']
well macbook is no less than expected .####['laptop general']
i love this laptop .####['laptop general']
i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !####['laptop general']
i ' ve only had it for one day and the set up was easy , and all items delivered were present , will update over time !####['os usability']
the display clarity is outstanding .####['display operation performance']
my only complaint is the click on the touchpad feels a little cheap , but i just use ` ` tap to click ` ` so it ' s not an issue .####['hardware operation performance']
transferring files from a non - iphone phone , like android is extremely annoying .####['software portability']
i made the mistake of thinking it was new .####['laptop general']
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####['laptop quality', 'laptop general']
it charges insanely fast .####['power supply operation performance']
i ' ll end the review simply saying i ' m very happy overall with my purchase !####['laptop general']
vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####['software operation performance']
upon further inspection , i had noticed that one of the side speakers was pushed in and the plastic surrounding it had a crack .####['multimedia devices design features']
it simply refuses to boot .####['laptop quality']
keyboard layout is not the best , do not like that i have to press the function key to raise or lower the volume / brightness on the arrow keys .####['keyboard design features']
so called msi tech support , went through the troubleshooting and of course they could not fix it .####['support general']
it randomly shuts down all programs running and goes back to the desktop like nothing was going on .####['os operation performance']
this laptop is my first time using the intel optane thing and after this i can not recommend it .####['laptop general']
it ' s a good system and has loads of space available for storage :####['memory design features', 'os general']
support got quite unpleasant when i ask about replacement .####['support quality']
the screen display isn ' t bright at all !####['display operation performance']
will not recommend it .####['laptop general']
worked fine until 3 months after i bought it .####['laptop general']
then the asus flip c302 came into my life :####['laptop general']
- excellent keyboard in all aspects - feel , rigidity , and backlight####['keyboard general']
surprisingly to me , the tablet form has been better than expected for reading .####['laptop operation performance']
this chromebook is great system that is lightweight , has excellent battery life , and offers a fantastic keyboard .####['laptop design features', 'battery general', 'laptop general', 'keyboard general']
touch screen is really responsive .####['display operation performance']
everything works fast and smooth .####['laptop operation performance']
the touchscreen is great though and feels very intuitive .####['display general']

so far i absolutely love it .####['laptop general']
