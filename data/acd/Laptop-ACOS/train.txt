acer wants $ 170 to just look at it then add the repair cost on top of that .####['support price']
update : i repaired it myself for $ 12 .####['laptop general']
i had nothing to lose since it was a paper weight otherwise .####['laptop general']
the shame of it is knowing it took me 15 minutes and $ 12 to fix it and acer wanted to rob me of $ 170 just to look at it .####['support general']
first one that they shipped was obviously defective , super slow and speakers were garbled .####['shipping general', 'multimedia devices general']
the replacement i got was much better , but still too slow for my expectations .####['laptop quality']
i wound up returning it .####['laptop general']
this works fine for that .####['laptop quality']
october 12 , 2017 - - started having trouble maintaining connection to wifi ( spectrum service ) , but usually after several loops re - entering password , connection would be re - established .####['ports quality']
sometimes had to do several times , but thought it might be an idiosyncrady of this model .####['hardware general']
now i ' m really bummed that i have a very nice looking chromebook with a beautiful screen that is totally unusable .####['display operation performance', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
i just got this thing today & was really excited about it but this has been frustrating & disappointing .####['laptop general']
i ' ll wait a while until this device gets 4 - 5 stars .####['laptop operation performance']
there are certain very basic tasks that this computer can do .####['laptop general']
a lot of websites don ' t work properly with the chromebook , even though you ' re using the same browser .####['laptop general']
overall , this thing can do very basic stuff , sometimes .####['laptop general']
pro : light , reasonable price , fast .####['laptop price', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
keyboard key fragile .####['keyboard quality']
after 6 months my eyboard key is not function very well .####['keyboard operation performance']
i only use the chormebook for surving the internet , checking my email , and watch hulu or netflix .####['laptop general']
this is something to reconsidered if one to buy the chromebook for doing homework and a lot of typing .####['laptop general']
up date per may 13 / 2018 about two months ago , the charger wont work .####['power supply quality']
so latest update the charger only last about one year and the half .####['power supply general']
overall , it is not horrible , but i wouldn ' t purchase this model again .####['laptop general']
- long battery life####['battery quality']
- charges quickly####['power supply operation performance']
- screen feels smaller than other of the same size .####['display design features']
it gets two stars because it is a nice light weight and the folding is nice .####['laptop portability', 'laptop design features']
two replacements had the same problem all in 4 weeks .####['laptop general']
i already returned the first laptop because i had to press extremely hard to get the left click to work .####['laptop general']
i ' ve had the device for 4 days now , and it has a number of big issues .####['laptop general']
next , is that the track pad is insanely wobbly .####['hardware operation performance']
one of the worst offenders is the battery life .####['battery quality']
it also refuses to charge past 90 % and instantly jumps to 80 % when i unplug it .####['laptop operation performance']
there are issues beyond these , but it ' s all software related so i will let it be .####['software general']
within two days of receiving this item a line appeared on my screen ( while i was using it , previously fine ) and below it the image / screen flickered .####['display operation performance']
the flip and touchscreen aspects work fine , no problems .####['hardware operation performance']
it can not .####['laptop general']
screen looks good , it has a good battery life , keypad has some nice feedback , the works .####['battery quality', 'keyboard operation performance', 'display design features']
but you can ' t use an acer chromebook r 11 this way .####['laptop general']
and the chromebook does not go to sleep or otherwise shut off .####['laptop operation performance']
loved it for an hour than it went black and we got a chrome os missing or damage message .####['os quality']
terrible product and worse customer service - - do not buy####['laptop general', 'support general']
we ordered this chromebook for my son to use for school .####['laptop general']
we received it in august , and it worked fine for just 5 months and then the touch screen stopped working .####['hardware operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
it worked properly for less than a week , and the touch screen stopped functioning again .####['hardware quality', 'laptop operation performance']
we contacted both acer and amazon , and they both informed us that it has to be sent back for repairs again .####['support general']
good display####['display general']
good battery life####['battery quality']
no fans and stays reasonably cool unless you are playing a game .####['fans&cooling quality', 'fans&cooling general']
build quality seems ok , keyboard is not flimsy or too firm .####['keyboard general', 'laptop quality']
my understanding is that chromeos is a very light weight so i don ' t know why it lags sometimes with under 10 tabs open and a youtube video playing .####['os operation performance']
i needed a small chromebook for light web use while traveling and this tablet does ok but considering the price i would have expected a better processor and keyboard lighting .####['cpu price', 'keyboard price']
my main complaint is the battery life , i see many positive reviews about the battery life .####['battery general']
i just find the battery draining to quickly in my opinion .####['battery operation performance']
i tried messing around in the dev mode to adjust the microphone sensitivity but nothing seems to work .####['multimedia devices general']
plug - in or usb microphones seem to work fine , so it ' s not a terribly big issue and i don ' t really even use a microphone that often , but it ' s annoying to buy a product and not have it working .####['laptop general']
the broken mic was not a dealbreaker but annoying in a brand new device .####['multimedia devices general']
in addition , in my short time using the device , i realized how much i dislike having fingerprints on my computer screen .####['out of scope general']
good looking laptop but hardware has several major problems .####['hardware general', 'laptop design features']
microphone is not really working ( you have to basically yell while alsmost touching it with you lips in order for someone else to hear you ) .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
when switching between tablet and laptop mode quickly the screen will blink and turn off for an extended period of time before turning back on .####['display operation performance']
called acer support , they were completely useless .####['support general']
keeps disconnecting from my wifi at work .####['ports operation performance']
it was nice when it was working .####['laptop general']
i ' ve called twice to try to connect it to printer , first call they told me i had to get a cloud ready printer after getting said printer it still doesn ' t connect .####['laptop connectivity']
very disappointed in this machine .####['laptop general']
i typically love acers ( i have a regular laptop ) but this machine has been a nightmare .####['laptop general']
issue summary : frequent crashing####['laptop operation performance']
6 - inch hd touch , intel celeron n3150 , 4gb ddr3l , 32gb , chrome , cb5 - 132t - c1lk####['laptop general', 'hardware general', 'cpu general', 'os general']
6 - inch hd touch , intel celeron n3150 , 4gb ddr3l , 32gb , chrome , cb5 - 132t - c1lk####['memory general']
it frequently crashes by displaying a bizarre screen displaying a large number of short horizontal lines and making a loud alarm noise .####['display operation performance']
this issue happens more frequently when using netflix ( app or through chrome browser ) .####['software general']
however it can happen at random , for example when signing into gmail .####['laptop general']
it ' s okay for email , facebook , surfing the net , etc .####['software general']
so , this one isn ' t working out very well for my needs .####['laptop general']
i hope it is fixed this time .####['laptop general']
the other is excellent !####['laptop general']
has lots of issues , screen freezing , i was hoping to use it for banking etc .####['laptop general', 'display quality']
it feels like a tablet / computer for a child since it ' s so bulky and heavy .####['laptop general']
the mousepad was not very responsive .####['hardware quality']
i really think it ' s junk .####['laptop general']
runs good , poor battery life .####['battery quality', 'laptop operation performance']
this one is horrible , never can connect .####['laptop operation performance']
after years of using amazon for hundreds of orders , this is my very first negative review :####['company general']
i was very excited at the prospect of buying this laptop .####['laptop general']
i was very impressed with its sleek design and the speed of the processor itself .####['laptop design features', 'cpu operation performance']
a few hours of use later , i noticed that my battery was very low , around 10 % .####['battery operation performance']
i even tried reinstalling the drivers and doing a system restore , nothing would fix it .####['laptop general']
i contacted asus and they could do nothing .####['company general']
i was so glad that the problem would finally be fixed .####['power supply general']
to my great dismay and disappointment , the power icon read the exact same message : ` ` plugged in , not charging ` ` .####['software operation performance']
this was the second vivobook in a row !####['laptop quality']
am i just unlucky , or was this a bad batch ?####['laptop quality']
i ' ve only found 2 other recent reviews of this product that had the same problem ( go ahead and search for them in the reviews ) .####['laptop quality']
volume was not working .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
they would help me only if i bought an ongoing support contract with them .####['support general']
horrible way to run a company so i returned the item .####['laptop general', 'company general']
i purchased this laptop on the 11th of june 2018 and today is the 25th , which means i have had it for just about 2 weeks .####['laptop general']
i noticed yesterday that the laptop was not charging anymore for reasons i can not deduce .####['laptop quality']
it appears the adapter may still be good as there are a few sparks when plugging into power but the charging light on the laptop does not come on and the battery is not charging .####['battery operation performance', 'hardware quality', 'battery quality', 'power supply operation performance', 'hardware operation performance']
i will attempt to return it as i am out of the us right now .####['laptop general']
it is quite disappointing .####['laptop general']
i am really concerned that this was not strongly made and just pretty .####['laptop general']
now a few weeks later monitor has died again .####['display general']
not worth it .####['laptop general']
i will return it .####['laptop general']
i thought it was a bad hdmi connection .####['ports connectivity']
this laptop is beautiful , and that ' s about it .####['laptop general']
it was fully charged and i only turned it on a total of 3 times before the screen went blank .####['display operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
at all and it took several minutes to boot up .####['os operation performance']
turned it off and on and the screen still stays black but you can hear it running .####['display operation performance']
cons - no light to indicate caps lock .####['keyboard design features']
delete and power button too close to each other and looks the same , i accidentally pressed the power button couple of times .####['keyboard usability', 'keyboard design features']
the built - in speaker is below average .####['multimedia devices general']
pros - slim , lightweight laptop due to 8th gen core - i5 .####['cpu general', 'laptop design features']
on day one , i had been using it for maybe 2 hours and it randomly shut off .####['laptop operation performance']
then the next day , same thing , screen goes black and it dies .####['display operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
im returning it .####['laptop general']
i will constantly be thinking about how it will probably fall apart in a few moths .####['laptop quality']
aside from that , laptop seems fine .####['laptop general']
feel like at max brightness it just isn ' t enough .####['display operation performance']
no backlit keyboard is kinda a bummer but i digress .####['keyboard design features']
the issue is that i got a faulty laptop and that ' s why the negative review .####['laptop quality']
i went with the asus vivobook based on the good specs , better hdd and ram , reviews , and because i could pay for it over several months .####['laptop design features', 'laptop price', 'hardware general', 'memory general']
their only solution was for me to go through the whole rma process and mail the laptop back for repair which would take weeks .####['support general']
i ' m amazed how bad this machine is for the money , and for being described as a ` ` mid - level gamer . ` `####['laptop general', 'laptop price']
it stutters on a 10 year old game .####['laptop operation performance']
the form factor is nice , but the power key is in the upper right , easy to hit when using backspac nor page up .####['laptop design features', 'keyboard design features']
thanks amazon for your great return policy !####['support general', 'company general']
super thin - love the color - had to completely remove the operating system though - too many viruses already on the computer when received - had to get my own operating system and re - install everything####['os general']
6 inch laptop it appears fragile the keyboard itself feels like the keys will pop out .####['keyboard quality', 'laptop quality']
sad that i can ' t return this one .####['warranty general']
plus the screen is bland .####['display operation performance']
with this asus i ' m experiencing 2 very disappointing issues .####['laptop general']
graphic issues : after opening any page or window with a black or dark color and i go back to a more bright or white page it takes at least 5 good second to gain the full luminosity####['graphics operation performance']
suddenly the keyboard goes crazy , starting on his own typing non stop ` ` mmmmmmmmm ` ` .####['keyboard operation performance']
this is very disappointing an causing me big issues while i write .####['keyboard operation performance']
it looks great as design , fast , but this 2 issues make it the worst buy of the past 10 years for me .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
the keys are easy to type on and the laptop itself is thin yet feels solid and well constructed .####['keyboard usability', 'laptop design features']
this is a well constructed and powerful laptop that is perfect for everyday use as well as some otherwise intensive task such as large spreadsheets or presentations .####['laptop general']
i double checked the outside labels and upon opening the box saw that the laptop had several deep scratches on the bottom of it .####['laptop quality']
i contacted amazon and have been issued a refund and ordered a replacement .####['company general']
the m key popped off during initial setup .####['keyboard quality']
amazon is 2 - day shipping me a replacement .####['company general']
i love it at first , but today my laptop wasn ' t not charging any more .####['laptop general', 'laptop operation performance']
i noticed today the laptop was not charging anymore .####['laptop operation performance']
it is very very disappointing .####['laptop general']
edit : reinstalled the driver now the audio is better on earphones .####['multimedia devices general']
camera is sd but not a problem .####['hardware general']
fingerprint scanner works well .####['multimedia devices general']
back lit keyboard should be a standard by now !####['keyboard general']
battery is all day amazing####['battery general']
with ssd lightning fast start up####['memory operation performance']
no back light keyboard####['keyboard design features']
performance is mediocre####['laptop operation performance']
consideration : if you are of average frame and strength then this build will be perfect and the keyboard flex and body is the perfect fit between lightweight and rigidity .####['laptop design features', 'keyboard design features']
my friends , both female and male , are going to by this set up for their travel needs but for me it is lacking .####['laptop usability']
this adds to my need for a strong system and willing to sacrifice some weight for strength .####['os operation performance']
best for : if you are looking for a travel laptop and are planning on doing light work this is an amazing buy for the price .####['laptop price', 'laptop portability']
not only is it light the battery charger is tiny and with the thin bezels this is a super compact design .####['laptop portability', 'laptop design features', 'power supply design features']
even with the fan and heat if you use a cool mat on your lap you will be find especially with the screen being amazing for the price .####['fans&cooling general', 'display price']
for the price it is an amazing starting point and hard to beat especially with such an amazing brand such as asus .####['laptop price', 'company general']
oh and this is a beautiful machine and the lid is amazing .####['laptop design features']
i like the laptop for it ' s hardware , and it ' s working properly .####['hardware general', 'laptop operation performance']
the actual laptop is very much darker and blue .####['laptop design features']
i ' m not at all happy about that .####['laptop design features']
the new computer failed again with the same error .####['laptop quality']
i am sure amazon will exchange it again but it is not worth the time and hassle .####['laptop general', 'company general']
the speakers are also not great and the max volume on watching netflix or other videos is rather quite .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
its an ok laptop , it makes crackling annoying noises sometimes , im worried that it will become worse with time so i will be returning it , also the speakers are really bad , keyboard is good enough .####['multimedia devices general', 'laptop operation performance', 'keyboard general']
the computer constantly pauses or stutters and then continues when it comes to loading web pages and working on documents .####['laptop quality']
overall , i ' m not very pleased with this computer .####['laptop general']
not happy with this one .####['laptop general']
the computer worked well for a few weeks , then the screen backlight died .####['laptop general', 'display operation performance']
the laptop does n ' t work .####['laptop quality']
i ' ve tried every single option and still ca n ' t use it .####['laptop operation performance']
unable to contact asus support for help .####['support general']
will never buy an asus product again .####['laptop general']
should ' ve stick with my pixelbook which was awesome and never have me trouble .####['laptop general']
return window is just a month , nothing can be done and now i am on mercy of asus .####['company general']
no backlighting on the keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
( i had to check that the caps lock was off after typing that last word . )####['keyboard operation performance']
for the backlighting , he sent me some zip files for atk and chipset which i don ' t know how to use and which i shouldn ' t have to use .####['support general']
the fan blows like crazy and it makes so much noise .####['fans&cooling operation performance']
i don ' t even think i will be able to work on this it is so distracting .####['laptop operation performance']
this laptop was delivered with the screen broken , it was the christmas gift and when we removed the gift paper se found a laptop thant not worked , that ' s unfair and that should not be done yo any people on christmas night####['laptop general']
battery life is only 3 .####['battery operation performance']
high speed laptop####['laptop operation performance']
mousepad doesn ' t work .####['hardware quality']
i have used this laptop only for work and the battery lasts and hour at most on mid performance .####['laptop general', 'battery operation performance']
will not be buying asus again####['laptop general']
two cons i ' m disappointed about is the battery life and the flimsy keyboard .####['battery operation performance', 'keyboard general']
has a genaric feel to it .####['laptop general']
they seemed to do nothing : fixing it was apparently my job .####['support general']
so now i ' m stuck with this dog but i ' m going to do all i can to get out the word that asus support is not the customer ' s friend : it ' s the customer ' s cross to bear .####['support general']
i ' ve had to reset the computer multiple times .####['laptop operation performance']
i returned it because the speaker is dead low .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
good laptop but the webcam isn ' t good .####['laptop general', 'multimedia devices general']
i would not recommend you buying this laptop , the specs are fine for the price , but the hardware is rubbish .####['laptop general', 'laptop price', 'hardware general']
power button is right next to the delete key .####['keyboard design features']
all around , a very lacking laptop .####['laptop general']
* * returning the device - - that unhappy with the item .####['laptop general']
dead pixel on display on arrival####['display quality']
the laptop charger has sparked repeatedly .####['power supply operation performance']
i will be returning this item .####['laptop general']
do not buy it will not search what you type in i want my money back####['laptop general']
this computer arrived fine but will not charge .####['laptop general', 'laptop operation performance']
how can a brand new computer not charge properly ?####['laptop operation performance']
screen backlight stopped working after just one month of light use .####['display operation performance']
i received this laptop promptly .####['shipping general']
great battery life , a matte screen ( non - glossy ) full hd .####['display general', 'battery general']
it will however win with substance .####['laptop general']
its about what is inside of this amazing product .####['laptop general']
the screen quality is excellent , and i am fussy due to my interest in digital imagery .####['display quality']
i can tell you for web surfing , the battery life is on par with what is advertised .####['battery general']
i could n ' t have put my feelings about my new acer aspire e 15 e5 - 576g - 5762 better .####['laptop general']
the 8th generation processor and ssd make for a very snappy computer , and the easy upgradablility is helpful now and will be useful in the future .####['laptop usability', 'hardware general', 'cpu operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
i / o : tons of ports , a dvd burner , solid keyboard with good feel to the key strokes , and a very precise and responsive trackpad .####['hardware operation performance', 'ports general', 'keyboard quality', 'optical drives general']
plus the screen is matte , so bright lights are n ' t glaring .####['display design features']
overall impression : this is a killer laptop for a killer deal !####['laptop general', 'laptop price']
i ' ve also discovered that the battery is better than i first thought , and will last 8 hours for light - duty activities such as web - surfing and word processing ; longer with power management on .####['battery quality']
my overall impression has not changed in the past 8 months , and i am still very impressed by it .####['laptop general']
thanks to its ssd , it boots windows 10 pretty fast , bloatware is kept to a minimum ( please uninstall norton before doing anything else .####['os operation performance']
: p ) , and the machine is definitely zippy .####['laptop operation performance']
oh , and the nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least ( grid autosport fps avg is in the 80s / 90s or so )####['graphics operation performance']
+ great and fast cpu and overall fast pc performance####['cpu operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####['laptop price', 'display design features']
- trackpad is too finicky and not my favorite####['hardware usability']
need to play with it a bit more .####['laptop general']
as of now , for $ 600 or less , this is a nice buy .####['laptop price']
this laptop is the best for the price in my opinion .####['laptop general', 'laptop price']
there are 2 pretty significant flaws in the design however , one i think might only be on my laptop .####['laptop design features']
- ips full hd screen .####['display general']
- pretty loud speakers .####['multimedia devices quality']
best pc bang for this level of buck .####['laptop general']
i will update this post if anything changes from what i posted , after i get the correct memory installed .####['memory general']
i have been beyond pleased with this laptop purchase over the last 6 months of use .####['laptop general']
i highly recommend this laptop for anyone looking for a great performing machine with an outstanding price ( just to be clear , it won ' t be running the newest high - end games on ultra - high graphics settings , but it still performs phenomenally for its price range and usage category ) .####['laptop price', 'laptop operation performance']
this laptop has been my traveling partner as i ' ve been traveling for 4 months , and i ' ve been extremely happy with the battery life , performance , and form of this machine .####['laptop design features', 'battery general']
it is also amazingly quiet : the ssd doesn ' t make any noise , and the fan only spins up if i am doing something intensive like playing games or running a heafty program - just browsing or watching videos / basic office work will not make this computer more than whisper .####['hardware operation performance']
so again , the battery is surprisingly great .####['battery general']
the keyboard was a bonus for me : i really like having the number pad for when working with spreadsheets and such , and this size laptop doesn ' t always have one .####['keyboard usability']
additionally , this has a nice backlight to the keyboard , which will turn off when nothing has been pressed for about 20 seconds ( great for when just watching or reading something ) or can be manually turned off entirely .####['keyboard usability']
in addition , you are gifted with an sd card reader and an optical drive which can read and write cds and dvds ( which i can ' t say i ' ve used other than testing that it worked , but i do remember how hazardous it is to suddenly need something like that and not have it available ) .####['optical drives operation performance']
- though the case is plastic , the keyboard area itself has a cold metallic feel .####['laptop design features', 'keyboard design features']
- the battery life is at least 8 hours .####['battery operation performance']
- the keys , often described as mushy , still have a decent click and distance to them .####['keyboard design features']
- the backlit keyboard looks nice .####['keyboard design features']
- i swear my screen periodically changes brightness but i can ' t tell if this is my imagination or not .####['display operation performance']
- the webcam sucks but i don ' t care about that .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
- easily upgradeable hdd ( it comes with a 512 ssd , which is fine for now , but is easily changed out )####['hardware usability']
- windows 10 ( do i really need to list the drawbacks of 10 ?####['os operation performance']
the e15 has a bright , 1080p screen - text is extremely sharp .####['display design features']
i also really like the finish on the case .####['hardware design features']
i wish the power cord were longer , but that ' s minor .####['power supply design features']
all in all , i ' m really glad i got this machine .####['laptop design features']
it has served me very well ever since .####['laptop operation performance']
so kudos to acer for the keyboard !####['laptop general', 'keyboard general']
this laptop has an amazing price for the hardware it offers .####['laptop price', 'hardware price']
multiple ports for anything you need .####['ports general']
decent sized track pad .####['hardware design features']
screen is ips .####['display general']
i figured out the day i got this laptop why the company was able to keep the price of this laptop even with the great hardware inside .####['laptop price']
it cost 8 dollars and shipping is not cheap .####['shipping price']
taking off the entire back of the laptop is very difficult .####['hardware design features']
overall the laptop is great for its price .####['laptop price']
i should also mention that i got this laptop when it was 100 dollars off .####['laptop price']
great laptop for expansion and upgrade .####['laptop design features']
all in all it is a great machine .####['laptop general']
best laptop i ' ve ever owned .####['laptop general']
this computer lives up to its expectations .####['laptop general']
the sound quality is ok , and even at full volume isn ' t that loud , but that ' s not a big deal for me .####['multimedia devices quality']
from the moment i opened it , i was thoroughly pleased .####['laptop general']
it ' s lightning fast and handles games like skyrim and the witcher 3 surprisingly smoothly for the price i paid .####['laptop price', 'laptop operation performance']
superb value for money and powerful performance from this quad core computer .####['laptop price', 'laptop operation performance']
it has and does everything it should .####['laptop operation performance']
screen is bright , doesn ' t feel heavy .####['display design features']
i ' m not a power user , so it is perfect for my needs .####['battery operation performance']
keys type nicely .####['keyboard operation performance']
only wish the power button was somewhere else , its too easy to hit accidentally .####['battery design features']
this laptop has handled everything i have thrown at it .####['laptop operation performance']
the screen looks good despite some other reviews .####['display general']
my cpu also runs over 3ghz most of the time with no heating issues either .####['cpu operation performance']
after running good for the initial 25 first days it won ' t power on .####['laptop operation performance']
i still find the one piece touch pads unreliable to use even after all the tweaking .####['hardware operation performance']
my first time with a solid state drive , very nice quick and quiet .####['hard disc operation performance']
i will painfully learn the new pads .####['hardware usability']
this is a light - use business laptop that we ' ve had for a month .####['laptop portability']
the screen is more than sufficient for non - gaming , business use , and it seems as fast as expected .####['display operation performance']
i ' ve owned several acer monitors that i ' ve always been pleased with , but this is the first computer .####['laptop general', 'display general']
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####['hard disc design features']
the screen looks great ( though maybe not if all you do is look at 4k resolution ) and the keyboard response feels pretty good .####['keyboard operation performance', 'display design features']
the battery life is not quite as long as advertised , but i can get through daily life just fine without lugging my charger everywhere .####['battery operation performance']
to get the features like this good luck .####['laptop general']
its so fast just click and 1 to 2 seconds it shuffles through youtube , videos , web pages , any thing .####['laptop operation performance']
people said it wasn ' t bright enough but i run at 50 to 75 percent and its white bright .####['display operation performance']
for the price , it ' s a solid laptop .####['laptop price']
the keyboard is easy to type on ( and the backlight is an added plus ) .####['keyboard operation performance']
you ' re not gon na find a deal like this too often .####['laptop price']
it ' s not perfect , but for casual users it ' s a steal .####['laptop general']
i love this laptop !####['laptop general']
i have the intel core i7 , soooo fast !####['cpu operation performance']
comfortable keyboard !####['keyboard operation performance']
love the cortana !####['software general']
first time user for windows 10 and it ' s pretty good .####['os general']
was very easy to add memory .####['laptop usability']
the acer is similar but bigger and heavier .####['laptop design features']
hope this review can save others from the initial hassle i endured because the chromebook 3 looks terrific in any other way .####['laptop general']
i bought the 4gb model which will hopefully last me a few years but it ' s nice and snappy now .####['laptop general']
the 16gb of ssd storage is perfect as i use it for school and the biggest file i might be storing would be a picture .####['hard disc general']
it integrates perfectly with my google account !####['laptop usability']
it ' s lightweight , has a long battery life and although it ' s smaller than a standard laptop , the keyboard is easy to use .####['battery quality', 'laptop design features', 'keyboard general']
the only thing i ' m bummed about is the lack of google play .####['software general']
i ' ve gotten more use out of this thing than i first envisioned .####['laptop usability']
i added an sd card which has expanded on the 16gb of storage .####['memory general']
i have been using a chromebook now for three years and am totally satisfied .####['laptop general']

it ' s been about 3 weeks since my purchase of my lenova laptop and figure it ' s time to give my all important review .####['laptop general']
love the price reduction and the lenova one year warranty .####['warranty general', 'laptop price']
pros : nice size , clear screen , quick on start up , very functional and easy to use .####['laptop usability', 'display general', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']

the keyboard is a nice size and the pads clicks on touch and not stiff or hard .####['keyboard design features']
it also has a lot of space and memory .####['laptop design features']
cons : i wished it had a backlight on the keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
the battery life sucks as it starts to die after 3 - 4 hours of use ( no gaming ) .####['battery operation performance']
lastly , the touch pad , even after lowering the sensitivity , it ' s still pretty sensitive and the click pads are stiff , so it doesn ' t tap on clicks , sometimes i have to click on it hard enough , so that ' s a bit annoying .####['keyboard operation performance']
after reading a lot of the reviews on here , i was unsure about laptop .####['laptop general']
only con would be that display is not that bright , although i would say at the brightest setting is probably where it should be .####['display operation performance']
also audio is pretty decent .####['multimedia devices general']
lenovo should put a better battery in it , and should make a retrofit available .####['company design features']
but if you keep it plugged in it ' s great !####['laptop operation performance']
lenovo paid for my shipping to the repair facility since i ' d had it such a short time , and they fixed and returned it in a reasonable time period .####['support operation performance']

i have had no issues with it since i bought it i would highly recommend it .####['laptop general']
i loved how fast it was .####['laptop operation performance']
also can not just ` ` add ` ` memory ddms : only one socket means you must remove the 8gb and purchace a 16gb ( ~ $ 180 further investment ) ; battery not gon na last several hrs , looking at ~ 2 - 4 .####['battery operation performance', 'memory general']
i love this laptop so far .####['laptop general']
the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####['os operation performance']
i was able to download all of my games in a quick amount of time too .####['laptop operation performance']
the laptop is the perfect size , it ' s not too heavy and it ' s slim .####['laptop design features']
have had mine for about 3 - 4 wks and have had no trouble .####['laptop general']
the tech and the quantities ( ram , etc . )####['laptop miscellaneous']
i love my laptop but the battery life is the worst i ' ve ever had on a laptop .####['laptop general', 'battery general']
it ' s still loading and working pretty fast and you ca n ' t beat the storage for the price .####['hard disc price', 'laptop operation performance']
overall i ' m happy with it for what i use it for .####['laptop general']
if your main priority is a long lasting battery this is n ' t for you .####['battery general']
great price for a nice laptop .####['laptop price']
bought this for my daughter ' s senior year of college and she ' s very happy .####['laptop general']
it is a very nice computer that serves his needs very well .####['laptop general']
8g is enough to do most daily activities , i use nvidia geforce now to play much higher end games like destiny 2 , r6 and what not .####['graphics general']
the only cons are the battery and the brightness of the screen .####['display design features', 'battery general']
this is a brand i look for that i feel i can trust .####['company general']
works great and looks great .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
great buy .####['laptop general']
the laptop works well , i have no complaints .####['laptop operation performance']
the only draw back with this pc is the battery life which lasts about 3 hrs before needing to be charged .####['battery operation performance']
nice little computer for the price .####['laptop price']
but i would have never bought it if i knew that windows 10 was the worst , god awful garbage operating system i have ever encountered .####['os general']
i hate windows 10 .####['os general']
liking it a lot .####['laptop general']
haven ' t had it long so only 4 stars but if it holds up it ' s worth 5 .####['laptop general']
has nice features for the price and nice video for streaming movies .####['laptop price', 'multimedia devices general']
bought this for my ten year old for school and creating .####['laptop general']
she loves it !####['laptop general']
i would buy this for myself as well .####['laptop general']
i wish the camera was a little better , but it ' s great otherwise .####['laptop general', 'multimedia devices general']
i do like it , just now that i had time to use it in preparing for my exams , the following was observed : -####['laptop general']
battery life sucks .####['battery general']
the camera sucks .####['multimedia devices general']
this is nice for the price and has good speed .####['laptop price', 'laptop operation performance']
this laptop exceeds my expectations for a mid - price laptop .####['laptop general']
the only problem is that certain streaming video applications freeze up in windows 10 and i can not remember how i resolved the problem on my old laptop .####['software general']
the customer support rep at amazon was of no help , though he did try .####['support general']
i use this laptop for work .####['laptop general']
otherwise , it ' s a good computer .####['laptop general']
it ' s pretty fast even with heavy use and multiple applications running at once .####['laptop operation performance']
love the laptop ; great quality ; sent as expected , on time .####['laptop general', 'shipping general', 'laptop quality']
it is far and away the best i ' ve ever had .####['laptop general']
fantastic computer .####['laptop general']
the programs run great with no lag time .####['software general']
battery lasts for quite sometime .####['battery operation performance']
it ' s not real fast and it doesn ' t have a lot of storage .####['hard disc general', 'laptop operation performance']
i don ' t ask much of a laptop so i am happy with it .####['laptop general']
it ' s fast , connects quickly to wifi , and the screen is quite nice .####['display general', 'laptop connectivity', 'laptop operation performance']
i liked the fact that lenovo came with the microsoft programs on it .####['laptop design features']
the only problem that i have found about lenovo is that it comes with a program called migration , which is supposed to migrate your things from your old computer to your new computer .####['software design features']
no problems with this computer .####['laptop general']
i enjoy that it has 10 key .####['laptop design features']
fast to start up .####['laptop operation performance']
for reference : ive had this laptop for about 4 months now for my first year at college .####['laptop general']
if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .####['laptop general']
youtube works well on here .####['software operation performance']
runs great - however , i just tried to upload my small adventure videos and the built in video player stops mid video about 10 seconds in - audio continues .####['multimedia devices operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
battery life is horrible though .####['battery operation performance']
easy to use and set up .####['laptop usability']
sorry not a fan of windows 10 .####['os general']
nice little laptop .####['laptop general']
nice laptop for every day use , with some extra features .####['laptop general']
my only issue is that the fan is very noisy and gets stuck at times , causing worry about the laptop getting overheated .####['fans&cooling operation performance']
i am very much in the causal gamer category , sims 4 being probably the most taxing ( on the system ) game i will play , and it seems to be running it just fine .####['laptop operation performance']
really happy with this laptop !####['laptop general']
i just received this product about an hour or so ago .####['laptop general']
i have yet to update the drives on it or try a game but so far its a good machine .####['laptop general']
i recommend buying it .####['laptop general']
very nice i love it it work very well even i instal gta 5 it run but not enoght video card mb but run at all####['memory general', 'laptop operation performance']
very good purchase .####['laptop general']
the price was great during prime days .####['laptop price']
works well so far .####['laptop operation performance']
price and product , outstanding .####['laptop price']
i like the size but dislike the battery life .####['laptop design features', 'battery general']
still learning but it ' s a good computer and a great deal####['laptop general']
it look like a professional laptop but overrall get this laptop you wo n ' t regret it , no negativity about it####['laptop general']
great computer for the price####['laptop price']
works well .####['laptop operation performance']
great laptop , very quick and efficient for work and casual gaming , got over 200 fps for steam games .####['laptop general', 'laptop operation performance']
great speed and storage .####['hard disc general', 'laptop operation performance']
i ' ve had it since may and enjoy it####['laptop general']
1 , the touchscreen stopped working after 6 months for finger presses .####['display operation performance']
samsung keeps telling me that the serial number is invalid .####['support general']
samsung ' s warranty process was not working properly for this device .####['warranty general']
when i called they would not accept the serial number .####['support general']
don ' t buy it .####['laptop general']
do not buy it like me , a samsung fan .####['laptop general']
this device ( and its brother the plus ) has a grave hardware flaw that causes the touchscreen to move on its own .####['hardware operation performance', 'display operation performance']
i got a replacement unit and it had the same issue .####['laptop operation performance']
samsung has not been helpful in getting this fixed .####['company operation performance']
it makes the entire device unusable .####['laptop usability']
ridiculous for something so expensive , some internet research shows numerous people having this issue .####['laptop price']
i like everything about the device , but the beautiful touchscreen ended up malfunctioning about 6 - months after purchase .####['laptop general', 'display quality', 'display design features']
samsung rma ' d the device to replace the screen .####['support operation performance']
the solution i am trying for now is to disable the touch screen .####['display quality']
hot / dead pixels on screen after 4 months use .####['display quality']
the pro worked great until now .####['laptop operation performance']
now there are pixels on the screen not working , and they are multiplying .####['display quality']
the pixels are currently stuck .####['display operation performance']
i will see if samsung honors their warrnty , if so , i will probably change / update this review .####['company general']
the chromebook is an amazing product with one huge glaring flaw - you can not use the sd card with any android apps , nor use android apps with wifi tethering or anything reaching ` ` outside the sandbox ` ` .####['laptop general', 'ports operation performance']
oops , i didn ' t anticipate android is crippled on here .####['software operation performance']
if you are wanting a beautiful screen that beats all other tablets for color range and matches samsung ' s galaxy tab s3 ( top android tablet ) , but if you absolutely must have a keyboard , don ' t buy this .####['keyboard general', 'display design features']
i am terribly disappointed with obviously a poor qc by samsung .####['company quality']
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .####['display operation performance']
returning it into a standard laptop position did not help , the screen actually turned dark and only closing and opening the lid helped return it to normal state .####['display operation performance']
to make things worse , i currently live overseas and am highly doubtful that samsung would do anything about this , given that it was bought in the us .####['support operation performance']
no matter where on earth , you can get your apple product repaired .####['support general']
in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this product given the obvious history of quality control issues .####['laptop quality']
wanting something maybe a pinch faster , but more importantly , a flippy touchscreen with google play support .####['display operation performance']
first and foremost , lets talk about the infamous keyboard .####['keyboard general']
yes , it ' s absolute garbage .####['keyboard general']
i ' m surprised people are settling for claiming ` ` it ' s good enough ` ` or ` ` gets the job done ` ` when every time i use it , i ' m constantly reminded of how i should have just sprang for the pixelbook when it was on sale for $ 699 .####['laptop price']
i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of keyboards and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .####['keyboard general']
my 2nd issues is with it ' s performance .####['laptop operation performance']
even in the early rounds the frames are heavily compromised and the entire game feels very sluggish .####['software operation performance']
i ' ll give the chromebook pro an extra star for its best asset , the screen .####['display general']
it does indeed look excellent !####['display design features']
it ' s also worth noting my unit came with a floating trackpad , with initial play before the actually click .####['display operation performance']
if you are indifferent about the screen , do not buy this !####['laptop general']
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####['laptop operation performance']
there is a power button on the side which i have accidentally hit quite a few times .####['keyboard design features']
i haven ' t abused this at all , and i noticed a small crack in the screen today and it ' s starting to spider out .####['display quality']
so $ 500 bucks down the drain as i ' m sure that isn ' t covered by any warranties .####['warranty quality']
with it being a touch screen it surprised me that it cracked and i have no idea how .####['display operation performance']
my screen stayed black more than it was on .####['display operation performance']
samsung needs to fix that issue .####['company general']
possible note , it was very light .####['laptop portability']
while this thing is gorgeous and the perfect size for what i was looking for , my initial display died after not even 12 hours of use .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features']
except , you know , when it decided to become unusable .####['laptop operation performance']
i just wanted to make it known my personal experiences with the device .####['laptop operation performance']
awesome display .####['display general']
fast boot and reliable os .####['os operation performance', 'os miscellaneous']
chassis could be studier and keyboard and trackpad very average and lack of backlight is a deal breaker for me .####['hardware general', 'keyboard design features']
mouse track pad is non standard .####['hardware operation performance']
it ' s hard to navigate and i had to buy a usb mouse and a usb connector .####['hardware operation performance']
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####['laptop price']
it is very limited and the competition for an actual usable operating system that can do a lot more than just browse the internet , are available .####['os operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
the quality is is meh .####['laptop quality']
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####['laptop design features', 'keyboard general']
it simply feels like a cheap samsung tablet with a keyboard attached .####['laptop miscellaneous']
the playstore its immature .####['software usability']
their designs are made for phones and on this huge screen , they are palpitated .####['software design features']
this is quite honest , a very expensive chrome browser .####['laptop price']
i do not recommend it at this price point .####['laptop price']
i would however spend $ 300 on this device .####['laptop price']
its current price is not worth it .####['laptop price']
after a couple of weeks i started experiencing web browsing issues .####['software operation performance']
first occasionally and later to a point where the laptop became unusable .####['laptop operation performance']
after some googling i realized that the wifi issue was related to bluetooth being on .####['ports operation performance']
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####['hardware operation performance']
10 minutes after finishing this review started having a new issue : touch pad started acting out .####['hardware operation performance']
you know , i wanted to love this machine .####['laptop general']
i went in to this purchase assuming that the availability of android apps from the google play store would make this unit into a true windows alternative .####['software usability']
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .####['keyboard operation performance']
' what a bunch of whiners , ' i concluded about all the people who slammed the keyboard .####['keyboard general']
so one star off for the keyboard .####['keyboard general']
needless to say , if you thought this capability would allow you to use a browser other than chrome , forget it .####['os operation performance']
none of their android versions were what i would call usable .####['software usability']
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .####['display general']
if you want to spend 5 or 6 hundred bucks for that , rock on .####['laptop price']
unfortunately , my chromebook that i purchased through best buy was dead on arrival .####['laptop general']
the problem is that it never charged .####['laptop operation performance']
the cable functions just fine .####['power supply operation performance']
the chromebook is simply dead from what i can tell .####['laptop general']
as you can see , the cable is active , but the ` ` power led ` ` has never had any color .####['power supply operation performance', 'power supply quality']
very disappointing , samsung !####['company general']
i really needed this product for work and had big plans for using it ' s features / versatility .####['laptop operation performance']
all i got was a fancy 2lb metal slab that can only be used to swat flies .####['laptop operation performance']
apparently there is some optimizations that google has done with the op1 and pixel that allow what is called instant ink .####['company operation performance']
i have also noticed the pro seems to run hotter and have a noticeably shorter battery life .####['battery operation performance', 'fans&cooling operation performance']
initially the product lived up to the expectations .####['laptop general']
there were challenges with the chromebook specific apps and the google play store apps worked sometimes , but most of them had the size issue where they are only the size of a phone screen .####['software design features']
reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .####['display operation performance', 'laptop quality']
also the case design is sort of rounded at both sides - a minor issue but it makes the device pop open in my purse and detracts from the ` ` feel ` ` of the device by making it feel a lot thicker than it actually is .####['hardware design features']
horrible , purchased directly from google , dead pixel on arrival , note feature did not pick up stylus and bluetooth rarely worked .####['laptop general', 'display quality', 'hardware general', 'ports operation performance']
sent it in , arrived back in an inadequate box ( i shipped it in the oroginal with protective foam came back in the box from samsung w / o any protection ) and 3 days after i recieved the item back the stylus fell apart .####['hardware quality']
customer service told me that i ' d have to buy a new one , item is still under warranty .####['support general']
i picked up the stylus and it fell apart , no drops no damage .####['hardware quality']
samsung makes garbage and treats their customers with no respect .####['company general']
never again will i buy samsung products and thats what i ' d suggest here .####['company general']
no caps lock on the keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
virtually every single app for it is compromised in some manner .####['software operation performance']
apps have to close and be reopened to get them to a somewhat decent size .####['software usability']
chrome os is not matured in any way .####['laptop general']
it calls itself a computer , but it ' s really not .####['laptop general']
it fancies itself a convertible notebook / app consuming functional tablet , but it is not .####['laptop general']
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####['os usability']
google is very concerned about arc to chromeos connections for security , etc etc .####['company general']
the rub is that chromeos itself is so limited in functionality that it is probably the most secure os platform out there .####['os general']
apps are glitchy .####['software usability']
samsung sent me a new stylus free of charge and free of hassle , which was nice of them because the top of the oem stylus popped off one day and could not be reassembled .####['hardware general']
certain apps ( especially flash based apps ) will get the machine very hot .####['software operation performance']
the bottom plastic piece - this is not a unibody machine - will be too hot to rest on bare skin .####['hardware design features']
i can not explain why , except to think that there is something wrong with the voltage wiring and the left channel is exceeding design capacity .####['ports operation performance']
the left charging port does not always make full contact with the charger and so sometimes the usb c charger is plugged in and slightly awry and therefore not charging .####['ports operation performance']
the touchpad doesn ' t have clickable function in the top right or top left corners which is becomes annoying for certain tasks .####['hardware design features']
many of acer ' s chromebooks have , historically , been hampered by their poor displays .####['display general']
the chromebook 14 has a 1080p ips display with fantastic viewing angles and excellent brightness .####['display design features']
i keep it at about 60 - 70 % and it looks fantastic .####['display operation performance']
it feels wonderful to finally say that about an acer display .####['display design features']
a more recent trend among chrome os devices is the inclusion of 4gb of ram and 32gb of storage , instead of the 2gb / 16gb to which we ' ve become accustomed .####['memory operation performance']
the extra ram , however , is great for everyone , as it makes this device more capable of running many tabs , or handling higher demand tasks like streaming content , without tabs crashing out or caching / reloading .####['memory operation performance']
the screen is great , for both media consumption and general computing / web browsing ; it offers a nice amount of local storage and solid performance via the intel processor and 4gb of ram , and it looks sharp , thanks to modern design queues and aluminum build materials .####['cpu operation performance', 'display general', 'laptop design features', 'memory operation performance']
it also has much better performance , including an easily upgraded m .####['laptop operation performance']
the acer is very nice , to be sure , especially considering the price or $ 299 .####['laptop price']
it also has pretty decent i / o with two usb 3 .####['ports connectivity']
i can ' t help but feel that people are also slightly exaggerating the performance offered by the n3160 .####['cpu operation performance']
it is solid , and does a decent job rendering pages , and paired with the extra ram here , it adequately handles streaming content in the background - such as youtube or spotify - and still maintains a decent browsing experience across eight to ten additional tabs ;####['laptop operation performance']
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####['laptop general']
i led with those first five points for a reason : being able to purchase a decently - performing chromebook with aluminum build , a 1080p ips display , 4gb of ram , 32gb of local storage , and an intel quad - core processor for $ 299 is basically what the entirely of the chromeos subreddit has been asking for over the past few years .####['laptop miscellaneous']
5 years old or matched by chromebooks at half the price , the absence of a touchscreen upgrade , or the use of slower emmc storage instead of a real m .####['memory operation performance']
these are all valid points that probably make this more of a 4 .####['laptop general']
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .####['company general']
even the touchpad and keyboard perform as well as the very best chromebooks currently available .####['keyboard operation performance']
anything that runs in a chrome browser on a desktop or laptop will run on a chromebook , and there are novel app - like extensions for almost anything else ( calculator apps , command lines , etc . )####['laptop usability', 'software usability']
for an office , you can give everyone a chromebook and their environment becomes available on login and disappears when they sign - out , and the machines can also be remotely managed if you ' re a google apps customer .####['laptop usability']
for students and road warriors , the extended battery life and automatic cloud integration makes sync - ing a breeze , especially if you hotspot from your phone .####['battery operation performance']
from the camera and audio quality through to the build styling , every aspect of this pc has been meticulously considered and it represents the best chromebook that has been delivered to date####['laptop general']
the keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice .####['keyboard general']
the hardware specs on this are very nice compared to other offerings : 4g ram , 32g storage , quad - core processor , etc .####['hardware general']
the screen is beautiful , and the speakers are very nice .####['multimedia devices general', 'display design features']
the mouse area is responsive , and has a nice feel to it .####['keyboard operation performance']
the overall unit has a slim profile , and is light weight .####['laptop design features']
thus far , i am very happy with the purchase , and highly recommend it .####['laptop general']
i think biggest reason i like it is that it ' s sturdy and i don ' t mind throwing it in and out of my backpack whereas with a $ 1000 mb air i might be a whole lot more careful in how i handle it .####['laptop quality']
hope to continue to get many more years of use out of it !####['laptop general']
bought this for someone else , can ' t believe how good it is .####['laptop general']
this thing is good .####['laptop general']
this is one of the best purchases i have made in years .####['laptop general']
since i already do all of my work in google drive , this is perfect for me .####['laptop general']
it ' s the best solution i ' ve used for collaborating on a budget .####['laptop price']
however , know what you ' re buying before you get a chromebook : it operates on a chrome operating system and you can ' t install apps or games on it like world of warcraft .####['laptop usability']
screen quality is perfect and matte so no annoying glare !####['display quality']
the keys on the keyboard are sunk in a little too low to accommodate for the sleek / thin profile .####['keyboard design features']
it take a bit of getting used to .####['keyboard usability']
first off the chromebook itself is excellent , one of the few budget models with 1080p and a long battery life .####['laptop general', 'battery operation performance']
it arrived in ` ` as new ` ` condition despite being a refurbished ( likely a return ) .####['laptop general']
it is a steal at $ 179 and worth a 5 star rating for the previous reasons .####['laptop price']
as other reviews have mentioned - its a bit heavier than expected for such a slim frame .####['laptop design features']
overall , i ' m definitely satisfied , i bought it wanting a well built laptop on the larger end ( which is why i ultimately went with the 14 inch ) with a solid material / frame .####['laptop general']
build quality seems excellent .####['laptop quality']
i purchased mine in the gold color and its beautiful .####['laptop design features']
beautiful ips display .####['display design features']
i ' m running it at 2500x1400 resolution extremely thin and lightweight .####['display design features']
now it kind of feels a little bit like windows but still different .####['os design features']
it on the developer channel and have full access to the play store .####['laptop usability']
update : device now has full support for the play store on the beta channel .####['laptop usability']
this makes this chromebook closer to a real computer .####['laptop general']
the system is quick , and used for browsing , and basic notes .####['os operation performance']
the keyboard gives a satisfying audible response to being used , and the mouse is nice .####['keyboard design features', 'mouse general']
that machine couldn ' t handle all the tabs i wanted to keep open , so after much research , i jumped into this acer .####['laptop operation performance']
it ' s great in many ways ; the build is solid , the screen is good ( and the resolution is insane ) , and the keyboard is decent , though only time will tell if it ' s as diet coke - resistant as the samsung ' s keys are .####['laptop general', 'keyboard design features', 'display general', 'display design features', 'laptop quality']
one thing keeps it from getting a five - star rave from me .####['laptop design features']
it is very light weight .####['laptop quality']
more importantly i appreciate the uncanny speed to boot up or wake up .####['os operation performance']
never has it run out of power while on battery .####['battery operation performance']
but they didn ' t make it $ 300 by wasting money , there are compromises .####['laptop price']
the 1080p display is very sharp .####['display operation performance']
you can watch 1080p video on it and it looks great .####['display operation performance']
i find the picture more watchable than my tv .####['display operation performance']
the audio is great .####['multimedia devices general']
the keyboard is good .####['keyboard general']
but the 4 gb of ram makes the things you use a chromebook for work without delay .####['memory operation performance']
where they didn ' t sacrifice is on build quality .####['laptop quality']
great device for browsing the internet .####['laptop miscellaneous']
hulu app is not supported for this computer so you will need to use the browser .####['laptop design features']
the keyboard is difficult to get used to due to the placement and spacing of the keys compared to a regular keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
the battery life has started to go down after a year of solid use ( still quite good ) , but the quality screen and chromeos make it worth it .####['battery operation performance', 'display quality', 'os quality']
acer put together a solid package .####['company quality']
i still had some of those kinds of mishaps with the chromebook - - but not nearly as many .####['laptop general']
the machine is great for streaming videos - - my wife and i use it regularly to watch things on amazon prime - - and the battery last quite a while .####['battery operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
he wanted something that could browse the internet fast - and this chromebook does just that !####['laptop operation performance']
i love how slim the design is - will fit easily into my backpack : ) highly recommend for everyday or school use !####['laptop general', 'laptop design features']
i ' ve kept an eye on chromebooks for the last couple of years as a possible option for a low - cost laptop .####['laptop price']
the chrome rdp app also works well , connecting to my windows machines with good performance , and i can access files on my nas using network file shares after using the chromebook for the last couple of weeks , i ' d confidently recommend one for everything but gaming and special purpose applications .####['laptop miscellaneous', 'software operation performance']
the quality of this unit exceeds my expectations , and if feels solidly built while still very thin and light .####['laptop design features', 'laptop quality']
the keyboard and track pad are both quite good , although i always use a real mouse .####['keyboard general']
battery life is excellent , and i can get several days use before needing to plug in .####['battery operation performance']
with a solid cpu and 4gb of memory i can run a dozen or more open tabs with good performance .####['cpu operation performance', 'memory operation performance']
saving the best for last , the full hd screen is one of the primary reasons i chose this chromebook , and it is wonderful .####['display operation performance']
to me , this chromebook is a great value .####['laptop general']
this acer chromebook 14 is by far the best chromebook 300 dollars can buy .####['laptop price']
with chrome remote desktop i am able to play turn - based video games such as hearthstone or civ 5 while miles away from the computer actually running them .####['software usability']
it is also very gnu + linux friendly if you want to replace the os entirely .####['laptop usability']
overall this chromebook is perfect for my current use - case and would recommend it to anyone in the chromebook market with 300 dollars to spare .####['laptop price']
it does not interface well with any printer i could find as nothing would download for a driver because it needs to be a mac or windows .####['os usability']
you can ' t use it to edit a word document .####['os usability']
i could not be happier with this computer because i am not the best person with technology .####['laptop usability']
i don ' t know how to use a lot of computers but this is simple and easy to use .####['laptop usability']
very easy to set up and light to carry .####['laptop usability', 'laptop portability']
this is an amazing computer .####['laptop general']
however , having been out of school for several years now , the viability of purchasing a mac ( particularly as they are increasing in price ) no longer seems viable .####['laptop price']
first of all , the battery life on it is insane .####['battery operation performance']
first , it is hard to run more than 10 tabs open at any given time .####['laptop operation performance']
first time users might have a hard time using the keyboard ( some keys like caps lock , pagedown , pageup , delete , home etc are missing , browse the internet to get the equivalent ones ) .####['keyboard design features']
the build quality is good ( all aluminum body ) .####['laptop quality']
the boot up is fast .####['os operation performance']
camera is not that good , so video call on mobile phone is better .####['multimedia devices general']
this chromebook is easy to use , boot up quickly but it does occasionally crash and a push of the on / off button will quickly reset it .####['laptop usability', 'os operation performance']
the chromebook is quite ideal for those who use their computer mostly for surfing the internet .####['laptop miscellaneous']
we actually returned the first acer chromebook 14 , we got because the screen would blink randomly and go off .####['display quality']
as for actual device it is completely gorgeous and ( now ) works flawlessly .####['laptop operation performance']
he was ecstatic at the power , the screen , the layout - pretty much everything .####['display general', 'laptop general', 'power supply general']
while the device is awesome , and there are lots of other reviews that will tell you exactly how awesome , i am just so impressed by how amazon ' s customer service handled the issue .####['laptop general', 'support general']
guaranteed excellent customer service !####['support general']
keep in mind , you have to pay $ for ms office where google docs is free .####['software price']
overall , the way i see it , i ' m getting a big screen hd android galaxy tablet with a keyboard for the price of a tablet .####['laptop price']
this acer is a web surfer that ' s easy to travel with .####['laptop usability']
first of all , this is a physically beautiful machine .####['laptop design features']
the keyboard is a delight with large , nearly flush , keys set to just the right level of resistance and sensitivity .####['keyboard design features']
love the style , aluminum shell , 14 inches monitor , and decent resolution .####['display general', 'laptop design features']
this little chromebook is very nice and is pretty much what i expected .####['laptop general']
this is my first chromebook purchase and i have to say that i ' m enjoying the speed and simplicity of it .####['laptop operation performance']
in summary , it looks great and performs very well .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
battery life has been very good .####['battery general']
acer makes a good unit too .####['company general']
i purchased this item 7 months ago and i love it .####['laptop general']
i purchased this chromebook strictly for writing / editing ( i ' m an independent and published author ) and web browsing .####['laptop usability']
the aluminum casing adds to the durable feel of the unit and gives it a nice attractive look as well .####['laptop design features']
the only thing i did not like about the design is the fact that the speakers are on the bottom of the unit .####['multimedia devices design features']
it ' s beautiful and i love it , but i think i have to send it back .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features']
losing the function keys for a toucher was a deal breaker .####['keyboard design features']
the base model went up in price $ 400 , which excludes any performance benefits .####['laptop price']
the only real upgrade for the new one , before adding on options is faster memory .####['memory operation performance']
i run windows and linux vms fairly regularly and while i could run them on a comparable windows system , adding windows systems to an already portly windows system has never worked out well for me , so while disappointed in the new upgrades , this 2015 model still rocks vms and does all i need it too for far less $ $ $ .####['software usability']
while usb - c is cool , a bag full of dongles is not .####['ports general']
with real function keys , i don ' t worry about one vendor or another not upgrading fast enough and losing virtual function keys , so this model is golden .####['laptop general']
anyway , if you are contemplating buying one of these and they are still available , do it .####['laptop general']
everything from the power cord to the computer looks brand new .####['laptop design features', 'power supply design features']
in fact , the only way you know it ' s probably not new is because it didn ' t arrive in an apple original box ; it arrived wrapped ( neat and tight ) in bubble wrap in an amazon box .####['shipping general']
with the recent apple upgrade to macbook pros ( the touch of genius bar or whatever ) , the price has jumped .####['laptop price']
i can ' t justify paying that kind of money for some ridiculous upgrade .####['laptop price']
happy i got a great machine for half the cost !####['laptop price']
i ' m seeing a lot of reviews saying they received the wrong item .####['shipping general']
the one i purchased wasn ' t the cheapest but for peace of mind i gladly paid it .####['laptop general']
- new radeon graphics card ( finally ! )####['graphics general']
- retina display is actually sharper .####['display design features']
i thought that it wouldn ' t make any difference , but it does on games####['display operation performance']
- the computer is 1 pound ( approx .####['laptop design features']
that is awesome .####['hard disc general']
super fast boot .####['os design features']
when the computer is working hard , it doesn ' t burn my lap anymore ( although i do feel some hot air flowing through my fingertips , when i am typing , but i am okay with that ) .####['fans&cooling general']
the plug keeps unplugging .####['power supply general']
with magsafe 2 , even the gentlest pull makes the plug to disconnect , which is very annoying for me .####['power supply general']
- memory is not easily upgradable anymore .####['memory general']
- ssd ( solid state drive ) is not easily upgradable .####['hard disc general']
- no ethernet connection and firewire 800 port .####['ports general']
- no audio in port .####['ports general']
now audio in and out are combined in just one port .####['ports design features']
i don ' t like this .####['ports general']
it ' s very expensive for such a simple device .####['multimedia devices price']
- the screen is harder to clean .####['display design features']
- keyboard keys have a shorter touch .####['keyboard design features']
i ' m okay with that given that the body is thinner .####['laptop design features']
in the beginning i felt a little weird about this trackpad .####['hardware general']
overall , i think it is a great purchase .####['laptop general']
with how slim this thing is i really don ' t see a need for the macbook air line .####['laptop design features']
the display is fantastic on this laptop .####['display general']
battery life : i haven ' t had the laptop for too long but easily get 8 hours or more on a charge .####['battery general']
the keyboard is ok .####['keyboard general']
other than that , the key sizes are good and the backlighting works just fine .####['keyboard design features', 'keyboard operation performance']
the trackpad has gotten better with this new model .####['hardware general']
the click is now provided by a haptic engine and provides more functionality .####['hardware design features']
the thing is fantastic .####['hardware general']
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .####['keyboard general']
apps open instantly and the ac wifi performance is very nice .####['software operation performance', 'ports operation performance']
you can even run time machine backups while the computer is sleeping now .####['software usability']
i ' m not sure when this feature was introduced , but it is very welcome .####['software general']
the os is easy to use , the app store lacks many apps that i use , so i have to go directly to the developers site to download them .####['os usability', 'software general']
i have not messed with the continuity feature much , but it is nice having the favorites and open tabs sync from my laptop to my iphone .####['software design features']
the current model only has two , which can be problematic if you hook up an external hard drive and an external bluray drive ( which requires two ports ) at the same time .####['laptop design features']
sure , another generation back was arguably better , but i find this computer to be adequate to my needs right now ( though it is a disappointment that i can ' t upgrade the ram , which definitely limits the lifetime of how long this product will last ) .####['laptop general']
it ' s nice and lightweight , the sd port is useful , and it ' s powerful enough for me to do fairly layer intensive graphic design work in photoshop and basic grading in lightroom .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance', 'ports usability']
the keys feel fantastic to type on .####['keyboard operation performance']
the overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold .####['laptop design features']
the force touch trackpad works great .####['hardware general']
overall , i feel this is the best laptop i ' ve ever purchased or used .####['laptop general']
it feels sturdy and reliable , both hardware and software - wise .####['hardware general', 'software general']
i waited for a while before writing a review about this product .####['laptop general']
after a couple of months of using this product , i finally could say that it ' s the best thing that i have ever bought up to this moment .####['laptop general']
regardless to the fact that the outside box was damaged , the inside box was fine .####['shipping general']
i use this laptop every single day for at least 2 hours and believe me it ' s just great .####['laptop general']
therefore , my advice to you if you ' re a student and you need a laptop for school , this laptop is the best choice for you .####['laptop general']
and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .####['os usability']
i ' m glad i got this .####['laptop general']
amazon warehouse marked this as ` ` like new ` ` but upon receiving , this unit was brand new .####['laptop design features']
i am very happy with this purchase especially for the price .####['laptop price']
at the time of this posting , this model was going only for 1800 for the 512gb with a dedicated video card .####['laptop general']
win for the ports , win for the price , and win for a brand new unopened macbook .####['laptop price', 'ports general', 'laptop design features']
love love love this laptop !####['laptop general']
the display is excellent !####['display general']
you can actually take a picture of this screen and not have near the amount of wavy lines that you used to get .####['display operation performance']
i really like the fact that when it boots up , it ' s up .####['laptop operation performance']
this thing boots up , you log in and you ' re ready to go !####['laptop operation performance']
my review is based on the fact that i got a pretty good value on this when it was selling for $ 200 less than normal .####['laptop price']
i ' m probably a bit biased on macs since i ' m a professional graphic designer , and it ' s just the industry standard .####['laptop general']
if you ' re considering a switch from windows based pcs to apple computers , i ' d probably recommend that you look at what you ' re going to use it for .####['laptop general']
for some of us , even though they are more expensive , they still offer the better value .####['laptop price', 'laptop quality']
fantastic computer !####['laptop general']
i was due to upgrade and this product seemed perfect for me .####['laptop general']
i have had three macbook pro ' s and all have been excellent .####['laptop general']
the key board is one of the best i ' ve ever typed on .####['keyboard operation performance']
this is my first ever macbook and i will never go back .####['laptop general']
i think the mbp ticks off more of the nice - to - have boxes for me than the xps13 overall .####['laptop design features']
the mbp does not run as hot as my old white mb did .####['laptop quality']
the battery life is really pretty comparable ( slightly more with the mbp , and i can obtain info on app energy usage a bit easier imo ) .####['battery general']
the trackpad is the ultimate difference - maker for me .####['keyboard general']
the mbp trackpad is best in class and if you are not using a mouse , this makes a huge difference .####['keyboard general']
the mbp 13 ` ` is plenty mobile .####['laptop portability']
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####['software operation performance', 'software general']
adobe apps are also power hogs , but that is to be expected .####['software operation performance']
i also feel like apple hides too much under the hood from the user , but i suppose you can still work around that if you are so inclined .####['company general']
an unexpected benefit for me has been the iphone / mbp integration .####['laptop design features']
i love the airdrop and receiving imessages on my mbp ( although it can cut into productivity if you ' re not careful ) .####['software operation performance', 'software general']
overall , it ' s a great machine .####['laptop general']
it ' ll be interesting to see what the revisions are in 2016 , but i was worried about the shallow keys of the new macbook making their way to the mbp and the loss of port options with a new revision , so i am very happy to have this now .####['laptop general']
it works great !####['laptop operation performance']
i updated it to high sierra and it ' s running smoothly so far .####['laptop operation performance']
battery life is good , screen looks fine , and all of the keys and ports are functional .####['display general', 'keyboard operation performance', 'battery general', 'ports operation performance']
the only thing i didn ' t like is the big dent on the front of the lid .####['laptop design features']
this was a outstanding upgrade from the early 2013 650m model .####['laptop design features']
as far as gaming performance , the m370x does quite well .####['graphics operation performance']
i predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 ( frostbyte 3 engine ) that this machine will perform well with the impending starwars battlefront ( also frostbyte 3 ) .####['laptop operation performance']
with the windows 10 / directx 12 improvements , frostbite 3 games will do very well on this machine at 1050p graphics / medium / low with the new starwars game .####['laptop operation performance']
nothing beats the quality of the mac os x as well , which is one of the main reasons for this purchase .####['os general']
but i fed up with the price it cost to upgrade the product as well as the software .####['laptop price']
i ventured back to the macbook pro world and purchased this model after much research .####['laptop general']
one of the first things i noticed after firing up this device was how quiet and effortlessly it performs all tasks that i ask of it .####['laptop operation performance']
- love the trackpad .####['keyboard general']
- performance and processing speed are bar none####['cpu operation performance']
- retina display is nice but not mind blowing as other have suggested####['display general']
all - in - all , i have been extremely satisfied so far with this purchase and am enjoying my not - so - cutting edge purchase .####['laptop general']
the screen is crisp and clear , easy to set up .####['display usability', 'display design features']
great deal on a great computer !####['laptop general']
my first mac and i ' m in love .####['laptop general']
so far it ' s running smooth with no issues as if it was new .####['laptop operation performance']
computer looked excellent .####['laptop design features']
it came in a regular brown box and the power cord was a bit scratched .####['power supply quality']
but the mac looked and worked great .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
this is the first macbook i have ever purchased , i wish i had purchased sooner .####['laptop general']
thought all apple products are over priced , i wouldn ' t have anything else .####['company price']
laptop in perfect condition .####['laptop general']
i like the size of the laptop , and it ' s processing speed .####['laptop design features']
laptop is as described .####['laptop general']
it didn ' t come with the box but it came with the charger and so far , i ' ve only been using for a few days , but i have no issues with the item at all .####['laptop operation performance']
looks brand new and the battery life lasts a long time ( see photos )####['battery quality', 'laptop design features']
i always was a huge fan of apple and i always thought the price on the macbook pros were too steep but i finally took the plunge and i ' m satisfied .####['laptop price']
the seller ' s customer service was great very fast response time and the computer came packaged really well , in original box and it great shape .####['support general']
if you ' re thinking about this or the 2016 version i ' d stick with this for now .####['laptop general']
the 13 ` ` is a good weight .####['laptop design features']
screen resolution super ( retina ) .####['display quality']
the display is beautiful and the amount if software you get makes it worth the price !####['software price', 'display general']
mac is life , but i take one star away for the price .####['laptop general', 'laptop price']
it boots up instantaneously .####['laptop operation performance']
my father is very satisfied with this laptop####['laptop general']
it came exactly as advertised .####['laptop general']
it is a small , light , powerful device that until 2016 seemed custom fit for content creators , photographers , and other such lines of work or hobbies .####['laptop design features']
it is expensive , but it is absolutely , positively worth it .####['laptop general', 'laptop price']
the new pro model is very light and compact , and can easily be carried around with you every day .####['laptop portability', 'laptop design features']
the display is amazing and the new force click trackpad is an awesome addition .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard general']
it ' s a little weird at first , knowing that the button isn ' t actually moving when you click down , but you definitely get used to it .####['keyboard operation performance']
the mac pro is also very fast , and i have only experienced the rainbow wheel once or twice whenever i was on a website that wasn ' t responding .####['laptop operation performance']
but so far this laptop has been up to its expectations .####['laptop general']
great computer but to took a while to adjust to not having as much memory as my last laptop .####['laptop general', 'memory general']
has a long battery life .####['battery operation performance']
i like everything about this macpro .####['laptop general']
stable , long battery life , and great build .####['battery quality', 'laptop design features']
as of now , highly recommended refurbished products####['laptop general']
the new retina is amazing and the speed is awesome .####['display operation performance', 'cpu operation performance']
the only detail that i have to reproach is that the connection cables are a little dirty , but in acceptable condition .####['ports quality']
love this mac book pro .####['laptop general']
well macbook is no less than expected .####['laptop general']
this new generation macbook has a fast processor , great retina display , 13 inch high resolution screen , great compatibility and many more .####['laptop usability', 'display general', 'cpu operation performance', 'display quality']
crisp screen .####['display quality']
i have had this computer for almost a year now and i love it .####['laptop general']
i have used it for business and school and wouldn ' t want any other computer for the job .####['laptop general']
i love this laptop .####['laptop general']
mac really knows how to build a good dev laptop####['company general']
im thrilled with my mac .####['laptop general']
i was a bit apprehensive at first will ordering such an expensive item online , but it was delivered in perfect new condition .####['laptop price', 'shipping quality']
i think i will forever be a mac user from now on , it is an awesome product !####['laptop general']
wonderful machine fast , clean , solid i have to said that this guy i fell from my hands the first day i use , goes to the floor and nothing happens screen is perfect and nothing is damage !####['laptop general', 'display general', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
this is my first macbook pro i ' m impress !####['laptop general']
i love this mac .####['laptop general']
received on time and the packaging assured that if those ups drivers dropped my computer , it would t damage it .####['shipping operation performance']
the computer itself is as stated and i received at a price my husband and i were both happy with .####['laptop price']
fast shipping .####['shipping operation performance']
what an excellent computer .####['laptop general']
as a refurbished item it was indistinguishable from a new item .####['laptop general']
condition even better then i expect .####['laptop general']
the mac works like a new one .####['laptop operation performance']
great laptop , excellent quality , definitely meets my expectations .####['laptop general', 'laptop quality']
the macbook was delivered soon and it is exactly as described####['laptop general', 'shipping operation performance']
i love this computer .####['laptop general']
it has been great for everything i ' ve done .####['laptop operation performance']
i would like to have more storage capacity but the ssd boots this laptop up in a matter of seconds .####['hard disc operation performance']
great price for a brand new product .####['laptop price']
now i keep seeing headlines for bad battery life and other woes for the 2016 edition and feel extra satisfied by my choice .####['battery quality']
slim , very fast , great screen , lightweight , solid state drives , great battery ( even though it burns the battery life when i play my flight simulator due to processing demands of the graphics ! )####['battery operation performance', 'display general', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
it ' s a great computer .####['laptop general']
the pro is by far the best .####['laptop general']
the retina screen does an excellent job of not tiring my eyes after a long day of computer work .####['display operation performance']
i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !####['laptop general']
if you ' re coming from a pc you ' ll love the battery .####['battery general']
1 - itunes match ( $ 25 / yr i believe ) keeps all of your music synced across all of your ios devices with no limit .####['software general']
the screen display is absolutely amazing and totally blows me away .####['display general']
january 21 , 2016 update : i love this laptop even more than before .####['laptop general']
feel totally comfortable with it , and will never go back to a pc .####['laptop operation performance']
it has been super easy to become familiar with it ; the more i use it , the more i appreciate it !####['laptop usability', 'laptop general']
this laptop is incredibly lightweight and slim ( ultimately won me over after years of lugging around a whopping 5lb levono ) .####['laptop design features']
i hate the new keyboard the newer version comes with .####['keyboard general']
the 2015 version has the old keyboard with keys that you can actually type on without the fear of a typo every other word .####['keyboard design features']
the battery life ( so far ) is fairly true to the description and has lasted me 8 hours of constant use .####['battery operation performance']
it ' s so much faster and the mac os is so much more secure .####['os design features', 'laptop operation performance']
love my new computer , there were some knicks on the outside but it works well####['laptop general', 'laptop operation performance']
this was exactly what i needed and it performs as new which is exactly what i expected as well .####['laptop general']
i ' ve only had it for one day and the set up was easy , and all items delivered were present , will update over time !####['os usability']
so i decided to use some of my christmas money to buy myself this one , and so far this is pretty awesome !####['laptop general']
it ' s a different computer overall due to the way you control certain things and what not , but that hasn ' t been a big deal .####['laptop operation performance']
i also like the display .####['display general']
the speakers on this model are really nice as well .####['multimedia devices general']
it ' s also awesome how the charger for this computer is magnetic .####['power supply general']
overall , i ' m very happy i chose this model .####['laptop general']
definitely glad i purchased my mac .####['laptop general']
the display clarity is outstanding .####['display operation performance']
i am fully satisfied with the purchase and communication with the seller was great .####['laptop general', 'support general']
i love the mac .####['laptop general']
i love it , it is as shown on the picture####['laptop general']
it is a great laptop !####['laptop general']
beautiful display and runs fast !####['display general', 'laptop operation performance']
a great laptop !####['laptop general']
awsome machine .####['laptop general']
as expected from apple !####['company general']
the best laptop i ever had including amazing retina display , light weighted , fast booting , high performance and prolong battery time .####['laptop general', 'battery operation performance', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance', 'display general']
great item by apple as usual .####['laptop general']
works exactly like it ' s supposed to work !####['laptop operation performance']
a wonderful device with extremely clear display .####['laptop general', 'display general']
one year later and the laptop is still in great condition !####['laptop operation performance']
the macbook pro is everything i hoped for and more .####['laptop general']
just made the move from pc to macbook !####['laptop general']
love my macbook , beautiful and use daily !####['laptop general']
my 17 year old granddaughter loves it .####['laptop general']
the rig works better than advertised .####['laptop operation performance']
it was as they advertised .####['laptop general']
great little laptop .####['laptop operation performance']
latterly the best laptop i ' ve ever had , fast , powerful , stunning display , little problems with pairing bluetooth####['laptop general', 'display quality', 'laptop operation performance', 'ports operation performance']
five stars with no doubt , thanks apple for such product####['company general']
i would highly recommend this product if you want to get into music production like myself .####['laptop general']
elegant design combined good performance , this laptop is almost flawless .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
small light portable , excellent screen , very fast performance and soo quiet , does this have a fan ?####['display general', 'laptop operation performance']
the battery lasts me days .####['battery operation performance']
this is a lovely product that i recommend for general use as a student , less so for gaming and storing whatnot .####['laptop general']
love it .####['laptop general']
i love the mac laptops , they are durable , reliable , light with all day battery and have awesome designs .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance', 'battery design features']
i love it .####['laptop general']
i am so excited about it and hope to see more of your products in the future !####['laptop general']
the best product .####['laptop general']
excellent packaging .####['shipping general']
fast delivery , brand new as expected .####['shipping quality']
the keyboard and os takes some getting used to .####['keyboard usability', 'os usability']
good quality all around hardware + software , of course that is what apple is known for .####['company general', 'software quality', 'hardware quality']
very nicely packed in original box .####['shipping general']
computer came in good condition and at a good price .####['shipping general', 'shipping price']
great value for money , the notebook is as good as new .####['laptop general', 'laptop price']
works great !####['laptop operation performance']
i have had this laptop for about a month now and every time i turn it on , i am still blown away !####['laptop general']
when i first got it in the mail and i opened it up and turned it on for the first time , i was a little speechless because the retina display looks so good !####['display general']
very clean computer everything looks brand new !####['laptop design features']
what ' s not to like , it ' s an amazing machine .####['laptop general']
also the battery life is great and lasts me an entire day ( i ' m usually on it all day too )####['battery operation performance']
great purchase , quick shipping .####['laptop general', 'shipping general']
excellent quality and very fast delivery .####['shipping general', 'laptop quality']
this laptop is absolutely everything i imagined .####['laptop general']
the computer is very beautiful and very light .####['laptop design features']
the retina display is stunning .####['display general']
this computer is amazing .####['laptop general']
the battery life is outstanding .####['battery general']
the internal flash memory is like greased lightning .####['memory operation performance']
i was super worried that touching the keyboard when it was in tablet mode would cause it to switch back to laptop mode , but it looks like once you move the screen back past like 180 degrees , it goes into full touchscreen .####['keyboard usability']
if you purchase this product , go into it with realistic expectations and patience getting familiar with the setup and you ' ll probably love it , too !####['laptop general']
i bought this chromebook on the prime day deal , but even without $ 60 off it would still have been worth the money .####['laptop price']
it looks way better in person than in the pictures .####['laptop design features']
since you have access to android apps on the google play store , you don ' t have to rely solely on the chrome browser to access apps .####['software general']
i haven ' t had issues with the track pad as others have .####['hardware usability']
i also bought a wireless mouse , which paired perfectly .####['keyboard general']
do your research , learn how to optimize your experience , and you ' ll love it !####['laptop general']
well , i have to say , i ' m fairly impressed with my new chrome flipbook !####['laptop general']
and the blue mail email app handles my multiple emails from multiple domains .####['software usability']
i ' ve used it for 3 days and still have n ' t plugged it in !####['battery quality']
it ' s fast , secure , easy to use ( even as a tech geek , it ' s nice knowing something ' s just going to work ) .####['laptop usability', 'laptop operation performance']
i ' m a writer , and this has easily become my main computer for both work and play ( google docs easily replaces word , and android apps make it much better for gaming than i originally expected ) .####['laptop usability', 'software usability']
the battery life is great ( i get about 9 hours ) .####['battery general']
my only complaint is the click on the touchpad feels a little cheap , but i just use ` ` tap to click ` ` so it ' s not an issue .####['hardware operation performance']
overall i love this machine , and all my computers will probably be chromebooks in the future .####['laptop general']
my desktop runs all my video editing software for my bigger and most demanding projects and my laptop is great for editing video and running pc games in places other than my home ( like school ! )####['laptop miscellaneous']
i wanted something i could work on my writing projects on the go , so i paid the $ 250 for this thing .####['laptop price']
when i recieved the item i was amazed at the quality of it .####['laptop quality']
but just at first glance , this thing is top quality .####['laptop quality']
nothing on it feels cheap at all .####['laptop design features']
all of it feels very strudy ( within reason ) and has a nice , modern look and feel to it .####['laptop design features']
i feel like this will look good in any decade .####['laptop design features']
i boot it up and notice quickly the display seems to be 720p ( or something close ) but for what i need this thing to do .####['display operation performance']
the touchscreen and the hotkeys along the top take some getting used to but i was quickly in the google play store , downloading all the apps i have on my phone and linking them to my accounts .####['display usability', 'keyboard usability']
` ` this thing is neat . ` `####['laptop usability']
i was supposed to use this to write !####['laptop general']
i use some other apps but nothing is quite the same for my workflow .####['software design features']
i thought the gizmo was neat but i was disappointed that i couldn ' t really use it the way i wanted to it that regards .####['laptop operation performance']
i was using my whole $ 3k desktop on this little $ 250 laptop and it ran flawlessly !####['laptop operation performance']
i could even watch videos and game from the laptop itself ( to an extent ) .####['laptop usability']
that is just incredible .####['laptop general']
for $ 250 i can control my $ 3000 pc anywhere .####['laptop portability']
this thing is the ultimate mobile workhorse .####['laptop portability']
this is the ultimate tablet .####['laptop general']
this thing is amazing .####['laptop general']
buy it for school , buy it for home , buy on for the grandkids .####['laptop general']
i chose this one mainly because of the full size keyboard , larger screen , and full size hdmi .####['ports design features', 'keyboard design features', 'display design features']
you can right - click by using two fingers to tap the track pad at the same time ( or 2 fingers on the touchpad , using one of them to press press down / click the touchpad ) .####['hardware general']
the feel of the touchpad is not as smooth ( frictionless ) as others i have used , but it ' s not terrible either .####['keyboard usability']
however , it does feel like a sturdy hinge .####['laptop design features']
the screen does not wobble as there is a good amount of friction holding it where you put it .####['display general']
reserve your judgement until you ' ve updated the software entirely .####['software general']
giving lower stars for not realizing its limited capabilities is your own fault .####['laptop operation performance']
i love the feel of a lighter os and can do many tasks using google / web based apps .####['os operation performance']
i can live with the so - so touchpad since the rest of it feels solid / sturdy .####['keyboard usability', 'laptop design features']
yes , this chromebook comes with the android app store pre - installed .####['laptop design features']
although 4 gigs of ram doesn ' t seem like a lot to some of us , because of the simple software , it is very fast with no lag .####['software design features', 'memory quality', 'laptop operation performance']
my wife upgraded from the 2 gigs of ram version to this , and it seems like there is more than twice the performance .####['memory design features']
the screen is pleasantly satisfying with the touch screen and foldability .####['display design features']
the power button is no longer on the keyboard , but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine .####['laptop design features']
this machine , through her minimum time of using it , has already been so much faster for her to use .####['laptop usability']
i ' m amazed at this product that has the same build as the other acer chromebooks .####['laptop design features']
we are happy to be selling her old one we bought just a few months ago , in replacement of this new r11 !####['laptop general']
1st , i was shocked at how easy it was to set up .####['laptop usability']
in preparation for becoming a chromebook user i had purchased a 256 gig memory card and moved all my laptop files to it .####['memory general']
it worked great .####['laptop operation performance']
every app i have downloaded from the google app store has worked perfectly .####['software operation performance']
amazon , as well as the google suite of docs , sheets , slides , and photos work great .####['software operation performance']
there nwere complaints regarding the lousy screen resolution , as well as the mouse pad not working well .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance']
this by far has been the easiest to set up and use .####['laptop usability']
it is fast and simple .####['laptop operation performance']
gates and this machine allows me to do this .####['laptop operation performance']
of course , i have only had this acer for a week .####['laptop general']
if something happens within 30 days i will return it but i will get another one .####['laptop general']
i am very happy with my chromebook !####['laptop general']
very poor experience .####['laptop general']
customer service did not respond for almost a week , and i ended up paying + $ 20 in shipping to return the device .####['laptop general', 'support general']
the screen just went blank and would not shut down , stayed in a cycle that would bring up some gray screen and then just turn itself into sleep mode .####['display operation performance']
it has been just over 6 months since purchasing this and it already needs a 500 fix .####['laptop operation performance']
this model has a defect .####['laptop design features']
the screen blacks out and apple has refused to fix it .####['support quality', 'display operation performance']
they have refused to fix it to date .####['support quality']
not sure what the deal is but extremely disappointed .####['laptop general']
the laptop is in great physical conditions , no scratches or anything , but certain actions run slowly , specifically any file read or write , like copying a document , uploading an image , creating a new file , etc .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
the other weird thing is a ` ` popping ` ` noise i keep getting when i use the tracking pad .####['hardware quality']
it ' s a clicking or popping noise that comes from the left side speaker .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
less than 90 days and the screen stopped working .####['display quality']
i contacted the seller and they seemed like they could care less .####['support general']
i bought this to save me money and now i wasted $ 700 to still have to go out and buy a new one .####['laptop price', 'laptop quality']
however there are many issues with this computer on start up that really bothered me and made my experience with a mac not that great####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop quality']
as soon as i turned on the computer , it froze as i tried to sync information .####['laptop operation performance']
another problem i had was when i awakened my computer from sleeping , the wifi would not work .####['ports general']
i fixed it , however it took intensive research to fix it .####['laptop general']
so if you want to buy this computer , make sure you ' re prepared for some early booting issues .####['os general']
i packaged it right back up and sent it back the same day i got it .####['laptop general']
i had this laptop for a little over a year and it worked well at first .####['laptop operation performance']
i only used it work my college school work and light browsing .####['laptop operation performance']
apple told me that they ca n ' t order those screws so i basically threw my money away on this laptop .####['laptop general', 'support general']
unfortunately this macbook is part of the ` ` staingate ` ` series , i would not suggest to buy this as apple doesn ' t seem to care about customers buying a faulty product that is very expensive####['laptop general', 'laptop price', 'company quality']
unfortunately , before i purchased it , i failed to research what the thunderbolt ports were .####['ports design features']
as it turned out the thunderbolt ports are of no use .####['ports usability']
the machine looks amazing doesn ' t it !####['laptop general']
as the hours in your day wind down , they will tell you to go here and there , call you back , ultimately to find out that , ` ` i ' m sorry but we do not cover that ` ` .####['support quality']
apple should ashamed to be associated with this cheap , lousy , clearly inferior , plastic nightmare - but then again , maybe that is exactly what they do want , so profits soar .####['laptop general', 'laptop price', 'company general']
i ' m pretty sure i ordered the biggest size , and i got the smaller one , but whatever it shipped fast and it works great .####['shipping general', 'laptop operation performance']
have not heard any complaints about the product .####['laptop general']
apple told me to upgrade it to just buy the new one when they release it .####['company general']
disappointed in reliability : used in a small business operated by my wife .####['laptop usability']
if known ahead of time , we would have not purchased this machine .####['laptop general']
apple used to make a wonderful product but my computer is now a useless paperweight until i have a new charger sent to me .####['power supply quality', 'company general', 'laptop quality']
stop working the macbook pro####['laptop quality']
hold on before you decide to pay $ 2500 for this laptop .####['laptop price']
it turns out that it ' s not a stain , but the anti - reflective coating coming off .####['laptop quality']
i went to the apple store and they said it would be 900 to fix .####['support price']
great aesthetics .####['laptop design features']
transferring files from a non - iphone phone , like android is extremely annoying .####['software portability']
everytime the charger is on the laptop , my left wrist will always get stung when it touches the side of the chassis .####['power supply quality']
ive researched this and it is very common and apple says it ' s normal .####['support general']
- high resolution / dpi screen####['display design features']
- thin and relatively lite weight####['laptop design features']
- fans run more often on the latest version .####['fans&cooling general']
- for such a premium price , this is definitely the worst purchase quality wise that i have made .####['laptop price', 'laptop quality']
the quality is terrible ( both versions ) for such a pricey product .####['laptop price', 'laptop quality']
this is not a new unit .####['laptop general']
i made the mistake of thinking it was new .####['laptop general']
i have had nothing but problems with my macbook connecting to my wifi from the beginning .####['laptop connectivity']
absolutly horrible product , cheap components make for unreliable products , but when the nearest service location is 50 + miles away i wonder how much apple truly cares ?####['laptop general', 'company general', 'laptop quality', 'laptop price', 'support general']
it started throwing i / o errors ( log viewer ) and occasionally ` ` system error - 50 ` ` would show .####['ports operation performance']
it would power on , start to boot , then abruptly power down .####['laptop operation performance']
my macbook pro 15 ” can overheating when some do it !####['laptop operation performance']
your new retina screen will get stains on it from the top layer seperating and or dead pixels .####['display quality']
overpriced low quality product .####['laptop price', 'laptop quality']
my laptop is affected by the staingate issue and apple denied responsibility , saying that it ' s a cosmetic problem caused by improper cleaning , yet there are thousands of reports on this .####['company general', 'laptop quality']
apple should be embarrassed .####['company general']
* excellent form factor , extremely portable while remaining a serious pro computer####['laptop portability', 'laptop design features']
* incredible display####['display operation performance']
* good keyboard####['keyboard general']
* decent selection of ports for its size####['ports design features']
* very weak wifi reception from the built - in antenna .####['ports connectivity']
the machine is near - unusable out of the box .####['laptop operation performance']
it stutters and pauses as you switch windows or use the ` ` show all windows ` ` or ` ` show desktop ` ` functions .####['laptop operation performance']
you have to ` ` increase contrast ` ` and ` ` reduce transparency ` ` in the accessibility options to make it perform ok , but with a ui that looks like s * * * .####['software design features']
paradoxically , this laptop is a ` ` pro ` ` .####['laptop general']
sadly , apple is moving into fashion - - your laptop is no longer a performing athlete .####['company general']
had it for a week now and still finding things it can not do .####['laptop operation performance']
this is a great computer .####['laptop general']
but how expensive it is .####['laptop price']
i can not leave now because i need my computer fixed .####['laptop general']
beware that stains in the coating of the display have been detected in all of the macbook retina editions .####['display quality']
however , after a couple of months the keyboard case started to crack at the corner .####['keyboard quality']
update - 7 / 30 / 18 - exactly the same issue has occurred with a crack in the keyboard cover on the opposite side .####['keyboard quality']
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####['laptop general', 'laptop quality']
i originally purchased this at the beginning of april after about a week it stopped charging ( would receive ` ` low power charger ` ` connected message and not charge ) .####['power supply operation performance']
i ended up returning it .####['laptop general']
my second asus chromebook has died .####['laptop general']
but asus chromebooks have a fatsl flaw .####['laptop general']
i was so excited to buy the asus chromebook , and bought some for my grandchildren .####['laptop general']
but this asus , who offered so much & rated over 4 stars , turned to a black screen , just over a month after i received it .####['laptop operation performance']
lo and behold , i hadn ' t read quite all of the 1 * reviews : the worst was a teacher who had ordered so many for her several classes and said ` ` i think the problem is with the motherboard .####['motherboard quality']
we ' ve got android nougat on beta running pretty well now .####['os operation performance']
most apps run pretty - ok in beta - some problems i ' m noticing in beta are that bluetooth is less than ideal and i believe battery life suffers greatly , now that i ' ve been paying attention to it .####['battery quality', 'ports general', 'software operation performance']
the stock video player misses audio on a lot of movies , and using the vlc app ( android ) is super buggy ( frequently freezes and shuts down ) .####['software operation performance']
it ' s increasingly disappointing to see the much - hyped play access is still nonexistent .####['software quality']
i ' m still loving the * idea * of what the c302 is supposed to be , but the execution is feeling more and more of a miss .####['laptop general']
needless to say , android / play rollout is being managed very , very poorly .####['software operation performance']
for the moment , please note - * * * this product no longer works with the google play store in stable or beta * * * and there is no communication about what we can expect , or when .####['software operation performance']
i will update this review when there is further progress - i believe this is a 5 star product but the updates are reducing my confidence in the software .####['laptop general', 'software general']
some of you will remember the asus “ transformer ” line of android tablets - pretty respectable tablets with tegra processors , decent builds , and most importantly - a keyboard dock that was far , far superior to any on - screen keyboard options .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features', 'keyboard general']
i remember them fondly .####['laptop general']
the asus c302 is , for me , the dream of that perfect asus tablet / keyboard combo made real .####['laptop general']
- the m3 processor is * plenty * of power for all chrome , video , and android requirements .####['cpu quality']
that ' s how confident i am in the asus after 10 days .####['company general']
- android apps work rather well , even if not perfectly yet .####['software operation performance']
i ' m still using chrome for almost all native google apps , however , since chrome tabs / apps simply work better / faster / easier than their android counterparts .####['software usability', 'software operation performance']
the c302 is clean and feels solid .####['laptop design features']
this is a nice perk to save battery life and for folks who like to read / / browse late at night in bed and do n ' t want the backlighting on .####['keyboard design features']
this is now my fastest - charging device .####['laptop operation performance']
it charges insanely fast .####['power supply operation performance']
- jstorrent works nicely for any torrenting needs .####['software operation performance']
- android support is only in beta mode as of february 5 , 2017 .####['support general']
i ' ll end the review simply saying i ' m very happy overall with my purchase !####['laptop general']
great machine out of the box .####['laptop general']
but after only a couple of days the thing just turned off and won ' t turn back on again .####['laptop general']
i tired every remedy found online , and even got in touch with asus tech support who just said ` ` send it back ` ` .####['support general']
and apparently amazon is experiencing a supply shortage because my replacement isn ' t expected until sometime between jan 11th to feb 5th !####['support general']
the c302 is a great machine .####['laptop general']
as of today , they can not give me a date on the return of my chromebook .####['support operation performance']
clearly , this is a company that can not handle repairs in a timely matter .####['company general']
this is a dreadful little piece of machinery .####['laptop general']
i ' ve had mine 10 months and the motherboard has crapped out twice already .####['motherboard operation performance']
bought it for a xmas gift , dead in less than 3 months .####['laptop quality']
it was an amazing laptop , until the graphics card started rotting after a month .####['laptop general', 'graphics operation performance']
edit : just shy of owning 2 for 9 months now and both are experiencing touch screen failure problems .####['display operation performance']
one of them keeps sliding the touchscreen randomly back and forth , and the other one disables a top portion of the screen randomly .####['display operation performance']
i loved this chromebook , it worked great for six months .####['laptop general', 'laptop operation performance']
now the romance is over ; it won ' t charge , and my only option is to send it in for service , a 10 - day event not including shipping there and back .####['power supply operation performance']
the build quality is fantastic .####['laptop design features']
the thing that made me return it was the trackpad .####['keyboard general']
the trackpad was very glitchy .####['keyboard general']
i had the trackpad speed maxed out and it still was bugging out .####['keyboard operation performance']
overall i like the portability and battery life on this device .####['battery quality', 'laptop portability']
my disappointment begins with the fact that chromeos is not touch - ready and most websites will not consider touch interface for desktop mode websites .####['os usability']
google ' s own services like google docs , drive , and gmail don ' t respond well to touch screen gestures often leaving me in despair .####['software design features']
aside from the larger capacity , it hasn ' t lived up to some of the other hardware i ' ve used .####['laptop general']
• super thin and light weight####['laptop design features']
• bright screen with good colors####['display quality']
• occasionally hangs for 10 - 30 seconds with no response from keyboard or trackpad####['keyboard operation performance']
i also decided that despite the advantages of the asus , i can not live with the sharp edges and middling volume .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features']
at first i was totally stoked on this chromebook .####['laptop general']
aluminum outer body , usb c charging from either side of the chrombooke , backit keyboard , nice screen resolution and fast processor .####['cpu operation performance']
then about 3 months in , it quit charging from the supplied fast charger .####['power supply operation performance']
i can plug it in and put it back to sleep and it will charge , but if i haven ' t woken it up it won ' t begin to charge .####['laptop operation performance']
the speaker crackling i can live with as i just need to logout and re - log in to fix it for about a week .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
the charging issue i can live with as well , even though it is annoying .####['power supply operation performance']
i would look elsewhere for a convertible chrombook , this one just doesn ' t quite live up expectactions .####['laptop general']
the design is very cool .####['laptop design features']
it has a good blend of functionality and performance at a great price point .####['laptop price', 'laptop operation performance']
i especially loved the high ( er ) resolution display , compared to most other chromebooks .####['display quality']
wifi was pretty bad .####['ports quality']
linux worked fairly well , and i was pretty pleased with it overall .####['os operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
as of the time of writing , the audio drivers are still not working , but i typically don ' t care for that anyways .####['software operation performance']
chromeos did well on this device , but i didn ' t like the scaling it did at higher resolutions .####['os operation performance']
but it lost the coil whine roulette - - badly .####['laptop design features']
long story short , i loved asus and have been buying them for years .####['company general']
i ' m in the us and asus wanted to charge me $ 60 cad for diagnosis only , and then said it would be an additional estimated $ 315 for repair .####['support operation performance']
it ' s a real asus hasn ' t been able to improve their customer service and support and won ' t fix this issue .####['support quality']
it just is missing a lot of other features that i wanted in a notebook####['laptop design features']
vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####['software operation performance']
the machine is easy to use , snappy , and everything the reviewers say .####['laptop usability']
the main bad for this particular variant is that google is no longer going to support it with updates .####['support general']
so be forwarded , if you buy this , you are jumping right into a machine that won ' t get updates anymore ( which is something most chromebook owners want and a feature that makes them better than android and it ' s fragmented market ) .####['laptop general']
many apps won ' t download and work on it like they do on an ellipsis .####['software operation performance']
asus has not responded to numerous request for an update of the status of repair .####['company general']
while under the warranty , asus sent me a fedex account with no instructions .####['support general']
but today i noticed it ' s cracking ( ref : pics ) .####['laptop operation performance']
i bought this as a gift and was incredibly disappointed as it did n ' t even turn on after the initial charging .####['laptop general']
very disappointed and i have n ' t even had the product for 12 hours .####['laptop general']
i loved everything about this chromebook until it stop charging 2 moths after perches , light just keeps flashing green .####['laptop general', 'power supply general']
the product came highly recommended .####['laptop general']
this is not an inexpensive product , especially for a chrome book but , i figured you get what you pay for .####['laptop general', 'laptop price']
yay amazon customer service they replaced it immediately for me no questions asked .####['support general']
the second one arrived , i had it from end of may june , to september started to notice the a key was a bit unresponsive at times .####['keyboard operation performance']
it gets rave reviews both on the ' net and amazon .####['laptop general']
in many ways , the computer has lived up to my expectations .####['laptop general']
it is the nicest chrome computer i have ever owned .####['laptop general']
it has one serious flaw though which is that the audio out can not drive headphones ( or earbuds ) adequately .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
even with the volume turned up all the way , the sound is very low which means that you have a poor soundstage .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
the one star is for warranty support .####['support general']
after about 60 days use the power adapter / charger stopped working .####['power supply operation performance']
- i love the chromebook overall####['laptop general']
- it freezes up depending on the program you use and you have to restart it .####['laptop operation performance']
- battery sucks .####['battery operation performance']
- horrible customer service .####['support quality']
build quality is excellent ( was .####['laptop design features']
online support from asus says they only repair not replace .####['support general']
this is my 3rd chromebook and it is , by far , the flakiest one i ' ve had .####['laptop general']
the bluetooth on it drops connections on a regular basis and the wifi is slow , slow , slow to connect on a regular basis .####['ports operation performance']
the space bar on the keyboard is inconsistent .####['keyboard quality']
works great as a chromebook but chromebooks are still very limited for android compatibility , at least this one is .####['laptop usability', 'laptop operation performance']
my main gripe is incompatibility with amazon prime videos and gogo .####['software usability']
about half of my home automation apps also do not work .####['software operation performance']
it works well for internet browsing and e - mail but i was hoping for much more .####['os operation performance']
i also hate the square rather than rounded edges .####['hardware design features']
this makes it uncomfortable holding it in tablet mode .####['laptop design features']
maybe i just got a lemon , but i decided to return this product after having it for less than two hours .####['laptop general']
as a computer , for typing and using internet in general , this computer is good .####['laptop general']
however , for using it as a tablet / computer with streaming , it seems to only work half the time .####['laptop general']
netflix and hulu seem to be working for the most part so far , but amazon prime and xfinity stream are both having issues .####['software operation performance']
i have had the computer for four months , and my computer suddenly wo n ' t turn .####['laptop operation performance']
so i call asus customer support , and received some of the worst customer service ever .####['support general']
the computer is great , but the charger is garbage .####['laptop general', 'power supply general']
it was terrible .####['laptop general']
so a for the computer , f for the charger , and a d for the customer support .####['laptop general', 'power supply general', 'support general']
very odd operating system .####['os general']
great except came with a bad left hinge .####['laptop general', 'hardware quality']
asus support seems to want to make this an accidental damage instead of warranty .####['support operation performance']
i can ' t recommend purchasing this based on what happens if you need support .####['laptop general']
the build quality , screen and keyboard are terrific .####['display quality', 'laptop design features', 'keyboard quality']
unfortunately , the downfall for me are the speakers .####['multimedia devices quality']
they just don ' t get loud enough and that ' s crucial for me since i watch a lot of youtube and listen to music while doing other things on the machine .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
it surfs the internet fast .####['laptop connectivity']
the touch screen broke four months after i purchased it .####['display quality']
the key board and mouse pad are not very sensitive .####['keyboard quality']
the sound and screen quality is low .####['multimedia devices quality', 'display quality']
disappointing battery life , even with light use i have to recharge every 4 - 5 hours ( at best ) .####['battery operation performance']
relatively small screen with high resolution makes reading the screen difficult .####['display usability']
android ` ` the computer will recognize your cellphone ` ` system never works .####['software operation performance']
otherwise , build quality is very good , starts quickly , very light .####['laptop design features', 'laptop quality']
when it works it ' s a great device .####['laptop general']
sadly after barely a year old it crashes all the time , the touch screen rarely works , and the track pad stops working until a reboot on occasion .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance']
asus support is responsive but ineffective .####['support quality']
i will never buy another asus after this experience .####['laptop general']
i bought this less than 6 months ago , and now it won ' t charge unless it ' s asleep .####['power supply operation performance']
it ' s basically a useless brick , with shoddy hardware .####['laptop general', 'hardware quality']
the computer is nice , blah blah it has nice features but it stops working after a few months .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
don ' t let them scam you .####['support general']
oh and the customer service is garbage .####['support general']
great little machine while it was functioning 100 % .####['laptop general']
very unsatisfied with warranty service .####['warranty general']
my shiny speedy asus chromebook froze after only one month of use and i am returning it today for a full refund .####['laptop operation performance']
cursor won ' t move and touchscreen won ' t work and from reading about this online i am not alone with this issue .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance']
product worked great until it randomly stopped charging .####['power supply operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
extremely disappointed as this was a gift to my husband .####['laptop general']
i bought this chrome book based on the high ratings , however i feel the quality just is n ' t up to par for the price i paid .####['laptop quality']
today , it stopped powering on .####['power supply operation performance']
i ' ve been chatting with asus support for the past half hour and they make the sloth from zootopia look speedy .####['support general']
so sad to report that after only a few weeks my asus chromebook has a hairline fracture .####['laptop general']
the touch screen never seemed to work properly and now i understand why .####['display operation performance']
this one is pretty , but obviously not sturdy .####['laptop design features']
this was a splurge for myself , which i rarely do , and i ' m so disappointed that it turned out like this .####['laptop general']
this is a great machine in many ways - - and with crouton could run full ubuntu , which made it a great little machine to write code on and deploy to a server .####['laptop general', 'laptop operation performance']
nice screen , nice feel .####['display quality']
i love the way it looks and feels the only thing i can complain about is the fact that none of these electronics come with printed manuels anymore also dont know anything about the camera only see me .####['multimedia devices usability', 'laptop design features']
overall this chromebook worked well and was reliable .####['laptop operation performance']
the wifi card recently died after 14 months .####['hardware operation performance']
now , my wifi connectivity goes up and down with regularity .####['ports connectivity']
not super confident this asus unit will last half that long .####['laptop general']
it ' s not worth what i paid for it .####['laptop general']
i will never buy an apple product again .####['laptop general']
beautiful machine .####['laptop design features']
app game ( simpsons tapped out ) ( i know don ' t judge ) lags at every moment .####['software operation performance']
chromebook is 2 months old and charger stopped working .####['power supply operation performance']
called customer service twice only to learn that i need to return old charger ( i pay $ 15 to return ) .####['support general']
there is a buzzing sound that comes from inside of the keyboard .####['keyboard operation performance']
excellent product , feels like quality all the way around .####['laptop quality']
product keyboard just stopped working after 6 months of use - called asus , and you have to ship it off for a two weeks repair .####['keyboard operation performance']
the chromebook seems to be working fine now and my daughter does love it .####['laptop general']
this is exactly what i needed in a laptop .####['laptop general']
however , the speakers are already starting to crackle , and i haven ' t even had the thing for a week .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
i still love the laptop , i ' m just a bit disappointed by this and i hope it ' s the only issue i see .####['laptop general']
the battery is far below what i expected .####['battery quality']
this computer seemed very exciting but after having troubles with 3 of them i give up .####['laptop general', 'laptop quality']
moreover i ' m quite upset because it seems amazon will not pay me back the shipping fees , which for me amount to about 100 $ as i live in france .####['shipping general']
the track pad has now stopped working .####['keyboard operation performance']
it is my only device with this issue in my home .####['laptop general']
i think it works well except for the wifi which is spotty .####['laptop general', 'laptop connectivity']
it keeps disconnecting .####['laptop connectivity']
in total , it took 4 updates to access the google play store - - completely unacceptable !####['software usability']
up until this point , asus chromebooks have been my favorite .####['laptop general']
i chose this device because of its power , app store , and a few other features trading off the option for an onboard stylus and improved screen resolution .####['power supply general', 'display quality', 'software general']
it also has a great backlit keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
i love how i can charge my laptop on both sides of the device .####['laptop design features']
wifi sketchy to nonexistent .####['ports quality']
i much suspect that google ' s half baked sustem is at fault .####['os general']
i liked the look , the speed , and the quality of the device but two had problems and not giving it a 3rd try .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance', 'laptop quality']
it ' s great other than the weak speakers and the touchpad .####['laptop general', 'multimedia devices general', 'keyboard general']
not only is the touchpad not great in use but it also feels poorly made .####['keyboard design features', 'keyboard operation performance']
i have been happy with this purchase .####['laptop general']
10 months in my battery will no longer charge .####['battery operation performance']
the first week i had my chromebook it locked up .####['laptop operation performance']
bought this specific unit because quality is well reviewed here and online albeit at 2x average chrome book price .####['laptop price', 'laptop quality']
look and feel of asus unit seems high quality but keyboard failed in 45 days .####['keyboard operation performance', 'laptop quality']
i opened the box after ordering on black friday , and the machine wouldn ' t charge .####['power supply operation performance']
the battery stopped charging after 3 months .####['battery operation performance']
customer service is difficult .####['support operation performance']
also battery life is max 8 hours , not 10 .####['battery operation performance']
however , the resolution could be higher , the scaling is bad , the colors are a bit washy , the weight is off as said earlier , the keys are kinda awkward , travel could be more , and the keys start squeaking soon after use####['laptop general', 'keyboard general', 'display general', 'display quality', 'keyboard quality', 'software general']
this product is built well , but it won ' t run the one android app i hoped it would run , and for whatever reason the app and os update download speeds are abysmal .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
but , now i realize the design is flawed .####['laptop design features']
and the worst customer service ever !####['support quality']
this laptop was supposed to be in ` ` like new ` ` condition but unfortunately , it was not .####['laptop design features']
after updating the software i noticed that the was a lot of backlight bleeding from the display .####['display quality']
upon further inspection , i had noticed that one of the side speakers was pushed in and the plastic surrounding it had a crack .####['multimedia devices design features']
only three months in , and the laptop won ' t charge .####['laptop operation performance']
something wrong with the battery .####['battery quality']
the keyboard broke after three months and it has been difficult to get any help from the manufacturer .####['keyboard quality']
the second the screen did not rotate .####['display operation performance']
and the screen was changing like creazy .####['display operation performance']
worked great for a couple of months , but now the sound goes in and out after a couple minutes of use like watching a video or playing music .####['multimedia devices operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
but right out the box the battery will not charge .####['battery operation performance']
i loved this chromebook but i had to return it bevause it had sound issues .####['laptop general', 'multimedia devices operation performance']
this worked ok for about a year and then just totally died .####['laptop operation performance']
had the chromebook for 1month and 5 days and it stopped charging .####['battery operation performance']
very good in all respects except a very important one which is the pathetic sound volume especially during movie playback .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
on the higher end for chromebook , but it looked really nice and had a good features and reviews , was in love with it until the power failed last november .####['power supply operation performance', 'laptop design features']
a thoroughly disappointing machine .####['laptop general']
mouse and wi - fi never functioned correctly .####['keyboard operation performance', 'ports operation performance']
machine periodically crashed .####['laptop operation performance']
after seven months , the usb - c ports stopped charging .####['ports operation performance']
now the hole thing crashed out of nowhere and i ' m going to lose everything i had on it .####['laptop operation performance']
+ nice , large screen####['display design features']
+ good battery life####['battery quality']
+ play store compatibility is available now .####['software general']
some apps don ' t play well yet , but should with time .####['software operation performance']
- although the screen is nice , the screen ratio is not optimal when using it as a tablet .####['display general', 'display operation performance']
- 3 months after purchase , the chromebook has issues with the screen flickering constantly and has been sent in to asus for repairs####['display operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
- the rma process needs improvement - buyer must pay to return the product for repair .####['hardware quality']
chromebooks are a waste of time / money .####['laptop general']
so disappointing to receive the laptop and it wouldn ' t even power up .####['laptop operation performance']
when in use , the lower screen is flickering .####['display operation performance']
i contacted asus support twice so far , however , they are not able to provide a solution to choppy video .####['support general']
the performance of my chromebook is the issue .####['laptop operation performance']
video playback is poor with the amazon prime video player .####['software operation performance']
great device until battery won ' t charge .####['laptop general', 'battery quality']
really disappointing results with sound volume and volume consistency .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
the aluminum body looks great , but feels cheap and thin .####['hardware design features']
speakers are weak and the volume range tops off half way .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
i just fear for the long term ruggedness of the exterior .####['hardware general']
after 3 weeks using this flip , i am quite happy with its performance , design .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
it ' s easy to use , convenient .####['laptop usability']
the keyboard is comfortable to type with backlit , screen quality is good enough for me .####['display quality', 'keyboard design features']
thin , light , cool are what i feel when holding it and carry around .####['laptop design features']
the reason for 3 stars is due to that i have a rickety feeling when touching middle of the right side frame of the screen , it doesn ' t affect to screen , i am not sure it is faulty or normal , kind of uncomfortable to hold in tablet mode .####['laptop usability']
the screen is nice .####['display general']
google play support is lip service only .####['support quality']
the problem dinvolves the headphone jack .####['multimedia devices general']
it would not charge at all !####['battery operation performance']
this is a great laptop .####['laptop general']
it has a weird smell that ' s why i ' m giving it 3 stars .####['laptop design features']
i wanted a large screen laptop with backlit keyboard and a lot of memory and this computer does not disappoint .####['memory general', 'keyboard general', 'display design features']
the notebook is decent .####['laptop general']
it is easy to use , light , and you have the ability to download apps for just about any need .####['laptop portability', 'laptop design features']
however , the bluetooth is a nightmare .####['ports general']
it just stopped working in the middle of my paper i was writing .####['laptop operation performance']
the screen is good , the tablet mode is nice , and the keyboard has a good feel .####['laptop general', 'display general', 'keyboard design features']
but after three charge cycles the screen started vibrating vigorously from side - to - side .####['display operation performance']
the tablet is good also , however can ' t they design something that covers the keyboard during tablet mode .####['os design features']
it is the best chromebook that i have ever used .####['laptop general']
both forward and rear facing cameras would be nice too .####['multimedia devices general']
great product ( perfect for student use ) but did n ' t last past 2 months .####['laptop general']
then the power cord went bad and i had to pay $ 50 for a new one .####['power supply general']
it ' s fine as a computer , but the lack of a real guest account made it not workable as a family room media machine .####['software general']
hardware is still pretty sound .####['hardware operation performance']
but i ' m growing ever more disenchanted with the core m3 processing speed .####['cpu operation performance']
also , the batterly life that is reported by industry affiliates is way off .####['battery quality']
google locked me out because after an update , my keyboard output was not as it should have been ( some keys were inverted ) .####['keyboard operation performance']
when i go to type something , it sticks and will not release .####['keyboard operation performance']
i will probably be sending it back as it seems too complicated .####['laptop general']
by far this is the most disappointing experiences that i ever had doing online shopping .####['laptop general']
at this stage i am disappointed than raging up and it wasn ' t the end yet the keyboard didn ' t work at all .####['keyboard operation performance']
nice chromebook .####['laptop general']
but seemed very poorly made for the money .####['laptop quality']
it is may 14 and it ' s not connecting to wifi .####['ports connectivity']
it won ' t hold a charge for longer than an hour , my son has to relay on this piece of cheap equipment primarily for taking notes and doing schoolwork .####['laptop price', 'power supply operation performance']
nice piece but battery holds only 3h - not 10 .####['laptop general', 'battery operation performance']
manufacturing seems unreliable .####['laptop quality']
also , often , the device simply would not power on .####['laptop operation performance']
loved this chromebook .####['laptop general']
first one i received , the space bar got stuck and returned it for a replacement .####['keyboard operation performance']
now , the headphone jack produces low volume at 10 percent capacity .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
the laptop is pretty lightweight .####['laptop design features']
cons : the speakers make a loud muffled white noise while playing music on occasion .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
on the one i received , the trackpad is hard to press down and seems to rub against the palm rest casing .####['keyboard design features']
screen is good .####['display general']
it is not up to my expectations , it produces some kind of sound when you play something on youtube ( from its keyboard ) perhaps !####['multimedia devices operation performance']
my main complain involves terrible battery life .####['battery quality']
speakers were messed up when turned on and the return did it still have n ' t processed even though it ' s been several weeks .####['multimedia devices quality']
very poor battery life .####['battery quality']
this computer was phenomenal for 12 days and then the charger broke and it is no longer functional .####['power supply operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
very touchy touch screen , too sensitive .####['display operation performance']
this is the worst computer i have ever owned .####['laptop general']
however , after having the computer for about 4 months it suddenly died one day and would not turn on .####['laptop operation performance']
udpate : after talking to tech support , i found out that they made the wrong repair .####['support operation performance']
worst customer service experience in years .####['support general']
the screen is great and the unit is fast .####['display general', 'laptop operation performance']
very disappointed in very bad tech support .####['support general']
this is a piece of garbage .####['laptop general']
then tonight ( april 29th ) my daughter says it ' s not charging .####['laptop operation performance']
bad touchpad , jerky movement , imprecise , no controls to improve .####['keyboard operation performance']
wifi radio loses signal too frequently .####['ports operation performance']
it began to shut down and restart all on it ' s own - continuously .####['laptop operation performance']
it sounded clean and simple , exactly what we need .####['multimedia devices quality']
very very very very weak battery and the play store is a joke , this thing still needs a lot of work to become a serious product .####['laptop general', 'battery general', 'software general']
beyond that , less than a week into the ownership trial , the power _ supply failed .####['power supply operation performance']
but basic stuff needs to be properly engineered and designed , and this machine had two huge problems right out of the gate .####['laptop design features']
good laptop , but not great .####['laptop general']
the screen is only pretty good .####['display general']
the touchpad is above average , but not great .####['keyboard general']
why does this company keep releasing faulty units from the production line ?####['company operation performance', 'laptop general']
2 - right arrow key not stabilized within the body and comes off .####['keyboard operation performance']
- display glass not glued well on one side .####['display quality']
screen not aligned perfectly .####['display operation performance']
i purchased this asus chromebook in may of 2018 and initially loved it .####['laptop general']
this is my third and last chromebook .####['laptop general']
it wouldn ' t charge .####['battery operation performance']
i really wanted to like this chromebook .####['laptop general']
unfortunately , the touchscreen is extremely insensitive , making it unusable .####['display quality']
everything was good for a few days after receiving the product .####['laptop general']
very disappointing in an otherwise great product####['laptop general']
the unit is sleek , nice and the keyboard feels tactily right .####['laptop general', 'keyboard design features']
but , when software compatibility began stacking up , it became a nogo for me .####['software operation performance']
very fast product , but with this kind of technology it ' s not possible to use a program , that i work ( minitab ) .####['laptop operation performance']
i ' m very disappointed with my purchase####['laptop general']
cpu and ram were running low .####['cpu operation performance', 'hard disc operation performance']
gpu wasn ' t drawing a lot of power because i was playing world of warcraft on the recommended settings .####['graphics operation performance']
got my replacement recently and i haven ' t had any major issues so far .####['laptop general']
i ' m still worried about the quality of capacitor and conductor inside this thing .####['power supply quality']
overall , it is a great laptop for the price .####['laptop price']
the cpu runs super fast and doesn ' t start utilizing its full potential until you start doing things like installation of applications , but the memory usage sits around 40 - 50 % the most of the time .####['cpu operation performance', 'memory operation performance']
my fan can get it as low as 82 - 83 degrees , consistently , while idle or gaming .####['fans&cooling operation performance']
the steelsteries keyboard feels great and looks awesome , but the keyboard surface of the laptop can get warm while sitting idle or gaming even when i have a fan pushing cold air underneath the laptop .####['keyboard design features', 'keyboard general']
the monitor is bright and colorful .####['display design features']
i don ' t see any problems with it .####['display operation performance']
keeping the msi software is optional , a few of these are useful like burnrecovery to make a backup of your version of windows just in case anything happens .####['software usability', 'software general']
i updated the realtek audio drivers and tested it using razer surround ' s audio drivers ; it still did not fix it .####['software general']
do not purchase this laptop .####['laptop general']
i had previouslu bought an msi mobo which refused to boot unless windows 10 was the os , but i had worked around all of those problems .####['laptop operation performance']
i should have known better : msi has boot issues , no way around it .####['motherboard quality']
it simply refuses to boot .####['laptop quality']
yet it fails to boot .####['laptop operation performance']
it is apparent the hard drive has failed yet again .####['software operation performance']
upon accepting a graphics driver update , the whole laptop froze .####['laptop operation performance']
i ' ve never owned an msi laptop and if i can help it , this one is going back and i will never own one again .####['company general']
* * update - so i closed and opened this laptop again , and the simple act of putting it to sleep and waking it up , as usual , caused a problem .####['laptop quality']
out of the box , gorgeous laptop .####['laptop design features']
keyboard problems too .####['keyboard general']
so far great machine .####['laptop general']
the laptop ran quite swiftly !####['laptop operation performance']
the temperatures were good , and the overall responsiveness of the system was fine .####['laptop general', 'os operation performance']
game performance was fantastic .####['laptop operation performance']
the intel rst driver ( for the hybrid drive ) version is old , and causes rare system lockups .####['software operation performance']
further , the msi dragon center ( default software on the installation ) caused a blue screen which lead to me having to factory reset .####['software operation performance']
msi used to have a driver installer by disk that would install all the proper drivers in the right order , so you ' d have the perfect configuration .####['software design features']
however , the laptop has no dvd drive , and no such driver dvd was provided .####['laptop design features']
it ' s possible i got bad hardware by chance , but all of the issues being directly traceable to drivers suggests the issues were all driver - related .####['hardware quality', 'software general']
second where the heck is my other 8 gigs of ram ?####['memory general']
its fast , light weight , quiet , and looks easy to add additional ram and hdd ' s .####['laptop usability', 'laptop design features']
i think this msi product will be a part of my business for a long time .####['laptop general']
i bought this laptop on black friday for $ 700 and i ' m debating returning it because i ' ve had quite a few issues .####['laptop quality']
im actually wondering if there is an issue with the speakers , it ' s so bad .####['multimedia devices general']
the battery life is terrible .####['battery general']
again , i wonder if my unit is defective because most reviews talk about this laptop having a 6 + hour battery life .####['laptop quality']
not sure it is related , but when i open facebook , aaaallllll the messages open simultaneously .####['software operation performance']
the unit is whisper quiet and hasn ' t gotten hot no matter how hard i push it .####['laptop operation performance']
i ' ve never had a computer as fast as this .####['laptop operation performance']
whether i ' m playing games or video editing , or web design , it doesn ' t hesitate .####['laptop miscellaneous']
i ' m not a huge gamer , but it can run crysis with full mods on ultra settings and doesn ' t make so much as a light hum .####['laptop operation performance']
honestly , i ' m debating returning this laptop .####['laptop general']
your mileage may vary but it ' s been a headache for me since i bought it .####['laptop general']
the battery on this computer is not very good i feel like i always have to have it plugged in .####['battery quality']
bad battery , speaker and touchpad####['hardware general', 'battery general']
it ' s fast , but the whole thing is wearing out quickly .####['laptop operation performance']
however , when i received this laptop , it stopped booting to windows after 3 days .####['laptop quality']
the ssd is not work after 4 month####['hard disc quality']
laptop runs really well but fans get a bit loud when gaming####['fans&cooling operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
this computer is fast , as the specs would have you believe , but i ' ve only had it about a week , and it has already crashed so bad once that i had to do a factory reset on it ( though , to be fair , the computer made the reboot super easy , so that was nice ) .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance', 'laptop quality']
the keyboard / mousepad isn ' t super comfortable for casual use ( like on your lap , sitting on a couch ) , so i think it is more meant to be used more or less exclusively for gaming at a desk or table .####['hardware usability']
it is heavy , but that is to be expected with a laptop like this one .####['laptop design features']
however , i tried to power it up today and kept receiving an error message right at startup that was a ` ` system boot violation ` ` .####['laptop operation performance']
, the advertised ram is 16gb and in the answer questions section has answers from the manufacturer saying ` ` this will have 16gb of memory ! ` `####['memory design features']
i did not get what i originally paid for .####['laptop general']
i don ' t know if i got a defective model or what , but something has gone wrong every time i boot up my computer .####['laptop quality']
not to mention it is quite clunky and large .####['laptop design features']
just that it seems that the hard drive doesn ' t work properly .####['software operation performance']
i really do like this computer , however the description is wrong .####['laptop general']
it only comes with 8 gb or ram not 16 .####['memory design features']
the keys feel nice and responsive however the mouse pad is a little over responsive .####['hardware operation performance', 'keyboard general']
the monitor looks fantastic , but i still cant get over the fact that you are basically lied to aboit memory availability .####['memory general', 'display design features']
the responses in the faq are wrong , this does not have 16 gb of ram , almost gave it a 1 star bexause of this reason .####['support general']
mousepad is a little wonky if you ' re not deliberate with your fingers , recommend using a mouse .####['hardware operation performance']
keyboard layout is not the best , do not like that i have to press the function key to raise or lower the volume / brightness on the arrow keys .####['keyboard design features']
the cooler boost button is cool , also like the fan placement and how the laptop is elevated in the back .####['laptop design features', 'fans&cooling design features']
in essence , if you want a gaming pc , this one will do the job .####['laptop general']
this laptop is actually horrible .####['laptop general']
everything about the experience has been terrible .####['laptop general']
the most recent incident is the sound wo n ' t work .####['multimedia devices quality']
i had this for all of a day before it began to have severe issues i set it back to factory settings and that worked for a time but it eventually had an issue with system 32 .####['os operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
within two months , there were too many issues / bugs with the os .####['os operation performance']
the screen would freeze , requiring a hard shutdown .####['display operation performance']
the computer ' s hardware is decent , but the materials are poor .####['hardware general', 'laptop quality']
the screen is surprisingly poor .####['display general']
it took hours to restore to factory default settings , and it crashed once again days later .####['laptop operation performance']
this is completely unacceptable for any computer to have this recurring issue , let alone a mid - tier performance gaming laptop .####['laptop quality']
i am still disastified even if this was a replacement####['laptop operation performance']
the last straw happened recently when i put it to sleep and it just wouldn ' t wake up - or rather it would try , and then spend the next several hours in a repair / analyzing mode that didn ' t actually do anything .####['laptop operation performance']
i have had nothing but problems with it since i bought it .####['laptop general']
and finally today , 4 months after purchasing it , it has completely crashed .####['laptop operation performance']
the computer can not repair whatever disc issues it has .####['laptop operation performance']
this was the worst computer ever .####['laptop general']
do not buy this computer !####['laptop general']
so far , it all works well .####['laptop operation performance']
today was my heaviest use of the new computer , and no less than 20 times have i had to undo / unscroll / unselect / unzoom .####['laptop operation performance']
multiple system crashes .####['os operation performance']
but let me not recommend it .####['laptop general']
was installing an update and the computer went black .####['laptop usability']
i bought this originally a few months back , died within a week .####['laptop general']
so called msi tech support , went through the troubleshooting and of course they could not fix it .####['support general']
eventually it bricked and died 3 days after any possible refund could be made .####['laptop operation performance']
if you want something that would last longer than a month , look somewhere else , as this is an absolute rip - off .####['laptop general']
it ' s a very fast laptop .####['laptop operation performance']
i use it for gaming and it runs rocket league at max graphics and it looks amazing !####['laptop operation performance']
i definitely recommend this if you are looking for a good gaming laptop .####['laptop general']
i have had to wipe this pc about 8 times in the short 2 months i have owned it .####['laptop usability']
its functionality is fine and for a gaming computer it performs well , don ' t connect an hdmi cable to it though , this will fry it , also don ' t turn it off cause you have a good chance of having to reset your laptop to factory settings .####['laptop operation performance']
i can no longer return it and have wasted $ 850 , the support refuses to get back in touch or provide any form of civility .####['laptop general', 'support quality']
i used this laptop mainly to play counterstrike and pubg which it did just fine until something got corrupted with the optane drive .####['laptop general', 'graphics general']
however , not to impressed with msi ' s customer support .####['support general']
playing a movie couldn ' t even last the duration of the movie on the battery , again , disappointing .####['battery operation performance']
its a sleek racecar of a machine and ran the new insurgency : sandstorm with ease .####['laptop miscellaneous']
if you buy this machine - be prepared for it to break .####['laptop general']
very good looking and fast laptop if only if it would stop crashing and having to reset back to default settings .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance', 'laptop quality']
it randomly shuts down all programs running and goes back to the desktop like nothing was going on .####['os operation performance']
stay far away from this laptop !####['laptop general']
only been using it for about a week , continuously getting the error that it can not connect to speakers .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
note that this laptop is only 45 daysish old .####['laptop general']
cpu and gpu are good , ram is good and i like the keyboard .####['cpu general', 'memory general', 'keyboard general', 'graphics general']
port options are nice as well .####['ports general']
the picture quality seems .####['display design features']
fans can get loud .####['fans&cooling operation performance']
speakers sound tinny .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
this laptop is my first time using the intel optane thing and after this i can not recommend it .####['laptop general']
it is freaking painful how long it can take games to load with that hard drive .####['hard disc operation performance']
i absolutely love this laptop , it looks great , its quality is amazing and can handle so many games without any lag involved .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance', 'laptop quality']
its battery life is really good , and the led lights are nice .####['battery operation performance', 'display general']
however , after weeks of having this laptop , its outgoes a bunch of problems .####['laptop operation performance']
the 1st problem that occurred is it kept shutting on and off .####['laptop operation performance']
2nd problem was the game card was damaged and 3rd problem was youtube wouldn ' t work again , and the search bar on the laptop wasnt working .####['software operation performance']
this bios is horrible .####['software general']
what was even worse was the customer service .####['support general']
purchased it the first time , thought it was faulty hardware , returned for a replacement of the exact same , and it had the exact problems .####['hardware design features']
i bought this product for black friday and i have been using it steadily since then .####['laptop general']
i have been using it for about a month and the screen already is having little white streaks on it without anything to cause it .####['display design features']
the inside is great but i feel like it won ' t last long enough before the outside crumbles .####['laptop design features']
the computer was a 50 - 50 chance to boot from day one , but we figured it needed to run updates and get settled .####['laptop operation performance']
this was a christmas present and now we ' re scrambling because it sucks .####['laptop general']
suddenly the laptop goes to sleep and doesn ' t wake up .####['laptop operation performance']
i bought this in august and i have had to completely wipe 2x and rollback after every critical update since november .####['laptop general']
definitely has issues with windows 10 .####['os operation performance']
system shutdown problems every month .####['os operation performance']
tech support is useless .####['support general']
update : i have had this computer for about 3 months now , and it is full of problems .####['laptop operation performance']
i got this laptop 2 days ago and it says plugged in , not charged .####['laptop general']
i replug and restarted the laptop 3 times and it still does n ' t work .####['laptop operation performance']
the fan is almost always on even if you have it set to automatic , although it ' s not loud .####['fans&cooling operation performance']
microphone is really low .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
absolutely terrible quality control to not even get past the initial boot .####['laptop quality']
had purchase this for my child to surf the net ; i ' d noticed ( and i can easily reproduce the problem ) , whenever her game needs to download an update , it seems like no data is coming down , while the harddrive activity ( read and write ) is very high .####['hard disc operation performance']
not a good quality laptop .####['laptop quality']
this laptop has good hardware specs , but the screen has very poor color coverage : 59 % .####['display design features']
it was crashing , it would restart and then the monitor would not work until i plugged it into an external one , and even then it would usually require a restart again .####['display operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
i returned this one as well .####['laptop general']
it is not a great build .####['laptop design features']
i had high hopes but sadly i had to return the second as well .####['laptop general']
computer was good but i would not recommend for battery .####['laptop general', 'battery general']
to bad the battery did n ' t work out .####['battery operation performance']
when it works , it works well .####['laptop operation performance']
but i ' ve had consistent issues with this laptop since i ' ve bought it .####['laptop general']
* * * update * * * this laptop has already bit the dust ; it crashed with a blue screen of death , and then refused to power back on .####['laptop operation performance']
what is the point of downloading games , files , anything , when a couple of weeks later it will crash and fail to recover !####['laptop operation performance']
i bought this because it had a good price .####['laptop price']
then suddenly it needs a software update which made my laptop crash .####['laptop quality']
the computer literally blue screened on the second day because system 32 was corrupt .####['os operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
when it does run it runs great .####['laptop operation performance']
do not buy this .####['laptop general']
will never buy an msi product again , and will tell every person i know to stay far away .####['company general']
it stopped working a week after i recieved it .####['laptop operation performance']
don ' t recommend it .####['laptop general']
i bought this computer a bit over two months ago for my son ' s college and after installing the windows update , it crashed !####['laptop operation performance']
do n ' t buy this laptop or brand .####['laptop general']
i barely do anything on it and it is a complete garbage can of a laptop .####['laptop general']
the screen will not work .####['display operation performance']
now the start up is failing .####['os operation performance']
i wouldn ' t recommend this product .####['laptop general']
it performs good for the price tag attached but it will have a booting problem atlest once every week and you have to format the machine .####['laptop price', 'laptop operation performance']
i do not recommend this to anyone in the gaming labtop market .####['laptop general']
update review : having had this laptop for a few months it has had a bad crash from a recent windows update .####['laptop operation performance']
very let down by the reliability of this machine .####['laptop quality']
i will never buy msi again and urge others to re - think about this brand .####['company general']
it gets used everyday for work all day long and some light gaming in the evening .####['laptop general']
so far the performance has been spectacular !####['laptop operation performance']
8 + lbs , this one is right under 5 so it makes it nice and portable .####['laptop portability']
this is my first msi and if it stays great i will be a returning customer .####['laptop general']
the battery life on the laptop is disappointing and the webcam doesn ' t work it .####['battery operation performance', 'multimedia devices operation performance']
received this laptop on july 30 , 2018 and by august 5 , 2018 , not even 1 week later , it has stopped working .####['laptop general']
msi should be ashamed at putting out products they know have issues with no intent of correcting the problem during the building and testing phase .####['laptop general', 'company general']
i can not recommend any products from this company and encourage everyone to avoid them .####['laptop general']
i really like the laptop and how fast it is and all the specs but , the internet started dropping only in this laptop .####['laptop connectivity', 'laptop operation performance']
good gaming computer .####['laptop general']
for the price i paid , this laptop can ' t be beat .####['laptop price']
for $ 499 the laptop is a bargain , but you should only buy if you you plan to add an ssd in the near future .####['laptop price']
+ the colour is a beautiful grey and not purple as reviewed by other users####['display design features']
+ fingerprint sensor is accurate####['hardware usability']
- power button next to delete button ?####['keyboard design features']
- caps lock without a led notification , not so clever .####['keyboard design features']
it does have an ips screen , battery life is going strong , and no touch pad issues .####['battery operation performance', 'display general', 'hardware operation performance']
definitely a steal at the price i bought this for .####['laptop price']
initial impression is that this thing is super light , almost 1 / 2 the weight of my asus ux501vw but with the same screen dimensions .####['laptop design features']
keyboard feels firm and no flex , screen is nice for the price range .####['keyboard quality', 'display price']
good sound quality####['multimedia devices quality']
horrible keyboard flex####['keyboard quality']
the max screen brightness isn ' t very bright####['display operation performance']
no backlit keyboard####['keyboard general']
horrible light bleed from the top edge of the screen####['display quality']
no ventilation at bottom of laptop####['laptop design features']
the laptop looks beautiful and the 8th gen intel core is a performance powerhouse .####['laptop design features', 'cpu operation performance']
the laptop is a little bigger than i had hoped and heavier than i expected it to feel .####['laptop design features']
to me back - lighting on a keyboard is a make or break so i might return the laptop though ( bought it because i could have sworn i read it was backlit when i purchased it ) .####['keyboard design features']
overall , its a pretty good looking laptop that falls short of feeling truly premium ( backlit keyboard , cheap quality screen , keyboard flex ) .####['laptop design features']
the display is brilliant , has the whitest whites and the blackest blacks , contrast is excellent and the colors are outstanding .####['display design features']
not only is it a hdd , but its a slow one .####['hard disc operation performance']
- keyboard isn ' t back - lit####['keyboard design features']
- no cd / dvd reader ( but who uses them nowadays anyway )####['optical drives design features']
highly recommend this laptop for mobile workers .####['laptop miscellaneous']
the ram is expandable ; i bought 8 gb additional and installed myself fairly easily .####['memory design features']
quiet keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
ok battery life , 4 or 5 hours of continuous use , but i ' m never far away from a plug so no big deal really .####['battery operation performance']
cons : delete key near the power button ( oops ! )####['keyboard design features']
internal graphics only ; not recommended for high intensity gaming or 3d modeling .####['graphics design features']
this has been a really good computer for the money .####['laptop price']
it is fast and lightweight .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
i do n ' t game , so not idea how that would go , but it ' s probably not bad .####['laptop operation performance']
the only thing i don ' t like is that the power button sits beside the delete key .####['keyboard design features']
it ' s a good system and has loads of space available for storage :####['memory design features', 'os general']
the 1tb included drive is pretty slow , but battery life and processing power is pretty great .####['cpu general', 'hard disc operation performance', 'battery general']
this computer functions very well as a gaming laptop for the price .####['laptop price', 'laptop operation performance']
the laptop runs smoothly and renders larger games quickly .####['laptop operation performance']
there are only two cons , the sound quality and the overheating .####['multimedia devices quality', 'laptop operation performance']
all in all a great cheap gaming laptop that even with the cons i am not dissatisfied with the product .####['laptop general']
i like this laptop , for a 15 ` ` monitor laptop with i5 - 8250u cpu , the weight is acceptable for me to carry it to work between different office .####['laptop design features']
the monitor is good , and graphic chip is enough for my office work , internet browsing and video streaming , don ' t think about what game it can play , i won ' t expect intel graphic chip can do a lot , if you want a gaming laptop , find some model with independent graphic chip , if you want a cheap laptop but can play computer game , you should wake up from the dream .####['display general', 'graphics operation performance']
just one question , now i am running the os on the ssd and the original 1tb harddisk just for storing file , its boot up and start softwares very fast , but operating with file explore is very slow , i already set the file explore not open the quick access but it still slow , rename will effective after seconds , copy file and even right click sometimes need wait for minutes , who know how can i solve it ?####['laptop operation performance']
awesome computer .####['laptop general']
as everyone else says ; the keyboard is not backlit .####['keyboard design features']
the original hdd in this laptop has some speed limitations for load up .####['hard disc operation performance']
the specs are good , its even faster since i added an additional 8b ram , making it a total of 16gb .####['laptop general', 'memory general']
the 15 ` ` screen is big and nice , this will make my examinations go much faster .####['display design features']
it ' s completely quiet , no heat whatsoever , and very fast !####['laptop operation performance']
good screen .####['display general']
perfect laptop for everyday use .####['laptop general']
i ' ve used it to do some basic video editing , developing applications , and some gaming and it ' s handled it all fine .####['laptop operation performance']
ca n ' t go wrong with an asus !####['laptop general']
i plugged it back in , let it fully charge as directed and have had no problems since .####['laptop operation performance']
the screen on this looks great , the bezels aren ' t noticeable .####['laptop design features', 'display design features']
well , wifi worked instantly without bugs .####['ports operation performance']
i ' ve had the laptop for a full day now and i can say it is quite impressive .####['laptop general']
the screen is also crisp and the speakers are punchy for a laptop .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
this is a great notebook .####['laptop general']
on the flip side , this asus is very fast with minimal bloatware that is easy to get rid of .####['laptop operation performance']
battery life is between 4 to 7 hours depending on what i ' m doing .####['battery operation performance']
i bought this laptop for software development .####['laptop general']
my only complaint is that the trackpad is just awful .####['keyboard general']
overall , if you just need a computer to do basic software development , remote work , or browse the internet , it ' s perfectly fine .####['laptop general']
it ' s pretty light , too , so it ' s easy to travel with .####['laptop portability', 'laptop design features']
the build quality is .####['laptop quality']
i am much more productive with this machine .####['laptop usability']
for me , it ' s been fantastic .####['laptop general']
would have been 5 stars if the keyboard was back light and the finger print reader had linux drivers .####['hardware design features', 'keyboard design features']
this by far one of the best laptops i ' ve ever purchased .####['laptop general']
( coughlenovocough ) this is a beast .####['laptop operation performance']
good for students that carry it from class to class .####['laptop portability']
also , the power button placement is not very good .####['keyboard design features']
it bothered me that i could accidentally press it while typing .####['keyboard design features']
i ' m a programmer and it can run all programs perfectly without delay and i don ' t have to worry about it .####['laptop operation performance']
the notebook is very well built and it could easily pass as a high - end machine .####['laptop general', 'laptop quality']
asus support is horrible .####['support general']
the support website is incompetent .####['support general']
this is a decent laptop no thanks to asus support .####['laptop general']
this thing is now light , fast and powerful enough to allow me to spin up some virtual machines to help with my study courses .####['laptop operation performance']
screen color is excellent .####['display design features']
fast , thin , great battery life .####['laptop operation performance', 'battery general']
monitor looks crisp .####['display operation performance']
no dvd drive , but who uses those anymore anyway ?####['multimedia devices design features']
the power _ supply is awesome .####['power supply general']
only thing i ' d change would be the hard drive .####['hard disc general']
processer is blazing fast ( competes with 7th gen i7 hq line - check cpu benchmark ) .####['cpu operation performance']
only complaint that i took a star off for is that the edge you rest your arms on is not rounded off and it is uncomfortable to rest on them for while .####['hardware design features']
display is ok not great .####['display general']
nice computer for the price .####['laptop price']
quick startup and has a nice display which is matte .####['display design features', 'laptop operation performance']
this is a great laptop .####['laptop general']
i really love the laptop !####['laptop general']
it works really well with my art programs and runs a lot better !####['laptop operation performance']
don ' t know what was going on , but , it seems like this laptop is working fine .####['laptop operation performance']
i bought the computer on january 2018 and so far i am really enjoying it .####['laptop general']
the computer has been running the programs such as matlab , mathematics , diamond , among others without problem .####['laptop operation performance']
for me has been worth the $ 500 for the computer .####['laptop price']
and it ' s light which is a big plus since i carry it to school .####['laptop design features']
i guess the computer is quite okay for the price they are asking for it .####['laptop price']
after using this for 7 months , i can say this is one of the better laptops i have owned .####['laptop general']
i used this laptop for 2 months without upgrading it .####['laptop general']
purchased this mid november , because of the 8th gen i5 , and other good specs for the great price .####['laptop general', 'laptop price', 'cpu general']
hdd , agree didn ' t sound good .####['hard disc general']
after that , it ' s actually been running well .####['laptop operation performance']
screen , i have it running at the brightest setting and looks fine .####['display quality']
the hdd sounds more like scraping on tin rather than fine steel .####['hard disc quality']
keyboard does seem a little off size as i seem to often be one key offset when get in typing position .####['keyboard design features']
internet runs well .####['ports operation performance']
downloading is very fast over wifi .####['ports operation performance']
i don ' t have need for the backlit keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
i ended up returning it even after getting a credit because the wireless did not work well and was extremely slow .####['ports connectivity']
everything is amazing , love the look and everything about it until now .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features']
what this tells me is that the hdmi port on my chromebook is defective .####['ports connectivity']
i read a lot about people getting doa versions of this product from the reviews and thought i got a pretty good one until now .####['laptop general']
manufactures need to quality check their products before sending them out .####['company quality']
after logging in to the replacement , the screen flashes black every fives seconds and restart the chrome browser .####['display quality', 'software operation performance']
the device itself is light and handsome - but virtually useless for long documents .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
chromebook is not a writer ' s friend .####['laptop general']
the build - quality is pretty good .####['laptop quality']
biggest gripe , no backlights on the keyboard .####['keyboard design features']
the keyboard is okay .####['keyboard general']
the trackpad is mediocre in use .####['hardware operation performance']
most of the time it works very well and one is subject to the vagaries of the various apps , browser , etc .####['laptop operation performance']
i find the screen resolution to be very good for video .####['display operation performance']
i can ' t really testify to its battery - life as i have not used it to the point where the battery is totally dissipated .####['battery operation performance']
all in all , i could live with this as my sole device if i had to####['laptop general']
after turning it on and logging into my google account i was getting an error when trying to run chrome .####['software general']
aside from that , it ' s a functioning web browser .####['software general']
we ' ll it ' s been a few weeks now with this chromebook now , aside from the initial issue , no problems .####['laptop general']
they ' re like a little - known gem , practically unknown in my area .####['laptop general']
i have mixed feelings about this acer chromebook .####['laptop general']
like the other one i borrowed , this one feels streamlined and easy to use .####['laptop usability']
it ' s easy find and delete pics and files you ' ve downloaded .####['laptop usability']
they have a low - quality , hard plastic feel and a weird textured grain to them .####['laptop design features', 'keyboard quality']
i wouldn ' t want to do any extensive typing on it .####['keyboard general']
the touchpad is hard and clunky .####['hardware operation performance']
even using it a bit makes my hands / wrist uncomfortable .####['keyboard operation performance']
doing general internet surfing is a breeze on this laptop .####['laptop operation performance']
overall , it works well and is easy to use .####['laptop usability', 'laptop operation performance']
it ' s still good for basic internet usage .####['laptop operation performance']
pros : streamlined and simple ; easy to use overall ; easy to find / delete pics & files ; good price ; looks nice from the outside , with the lid down ; good 14 ` ` screen size that ' s surprisingly hard to find####['laptop usability', 'laptop price', 'laptop design features', 'display general']
cons : webcam doesn ' t have video - only takes pics ; awful , uncomfortable keyboard & trackpad ; chromebook extensions are lacking and don ' t address / make up for the limitations of this chromebook ; a bit heavy and clunky ; hard to figure out google cloud print####['laptop design features', 'hardware design features', 'keyboard operation performance']
also on this model the ssd is not replaceable .####['hard disc design features']
i went online and found that the 1 year acer warranty had already expired .####['warranty general']
also upon turning it on , i got a blue screen .####['os operation performance']
the trackpad is awful as are most acer trackpads .####['hardware operation performance']
this happened 7 times within 20 minutes when i was working on something .####['laptop operation performance']
i am returning immediately , no patience for this .####['laptop operation performance']
everything lagged and the screen flickered .####['display operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
i just received the computer back from repairs and it worked for about 2 days and the same problem started happening again .####['laptop quality']
unfortunately this chromebook is very sluggish .####['laptop operation performance']
i wouldn ' t recommend this chromebook .####['laptop general']
while the product worked decently for about a month , it went downhill soon after .####['laptop operation performance']
not only did i get the laptop with a dented corner , the screen constantly flickers and cuts out on occasion , the entire laptop freezes for no discernible reason , and the mouse has completely stopped working twice .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
computer arrived doa .####['laptop general']
the keys and mouse pad are responsive and comfortable to use .####['keyboard operation performance']
now my main complaint is that is it very slow , especially for a new computer !####['laptop operation performance']
big learning curve , would hate to see someone older try and figure it out .####['laptop usability']
the drag and drop works poorly which is very annoying .####['os operation performance']
on the upside , the internet is lightning fast and it interfaces with tv through hdmi which is great , is bluetooth compatible and has two usb ports .####['ports portability', 'ports usability']
overall a good buy .####['laptop general']
liked it when it was working , but it ' s a paperweight now .####['laptop general']
acer had no answer for that question .####['support general']
next day during a video froze and just kept looping one section as it froze , and then froze and made a horrible loud scratching noise .####['laptop operation performance']
completely aggravated , sending this crap back as soon as i hear from them .####['laptop general']
computer was used very little and stopped working after 6 months####['laptop operation performance']
technical support was easy to reach , but not able to stop the problem i was having .####['support general']
support got quite unpleasant when i ask about replacement .####['support quality']
other than that , i like it , and this is my first chromebook .####['laptop general']
but this one was a piece of trash .####['laptop general']
power cord broke within the first two weeks of use .####['power supply quality']
otherwise computer seems okay .####['laptop general']
i ' ve had it for less than two months it randomly shuts down .####['laptop operation performance']
trackpad keeps breaking .####['hardware operation performance']
acer support is awful .####['support quality']
other people online seem to have this same problem with the trackpad , but acer pretends they have never heard of it .####['hardware operation performance', 'company general']
third time in 5 months that the touchpad became unresponsive .####['hardware operation performance']
very low quality build and quality support .####['support quality', 'laptop quality']
was able to get past setting up the log in info , but then once you log in the screen continuously goes black and comes back on and goes black and comes back on ; continuous cycle .####['display operation performance']
i ' m thinking i got a dud , so i ' ll update this review once i can get it resolved hopefully with a replacement .####['laptop general']
one of the two usb ports is defective , which is an enormous pain .####['ports operation performance']
also , chromeos does not allow color / temperature calibration of the display device .####['os design features']
i gave it 3 out of 5 stars , because there is no sd card slot !####['ports general']
nice screen and keyboard , touch pad is great .####['display general', 'keyboard general']
then it just rebooted without prompt .####['laptop operation performance']
it ' s already bricked and i did n ' t even use it for more than one day .####['laptop quality']
very disappointed with the wireless radio in this chromebook .####['multimedia devices general']
the sad part is i truly do like acer products , but this made me rethink this purchase .####['laptop general']
it ' s terrible .####['laptop general']
i could have bought a new pc for the money , but figured the slim chromebook was handy , and the word on line was it was great for exactly the reasons i wanted it , as a wireless entertainment center .####['software general']
i wish i could give it away at this point .####['laptop general']
acer ' s customer service is by far the worst .####['support quality']
very good build quality , except for the keyboard apparently , sound was very big , very fast boot times and so much more .####['os operation performance', 'keyboard quality', 'multimedia devices operation performance', 'laptop quality']
the track pad is one of the best i have seen for a non - apple touch pad .####['keyboard general']
feels nice and looks good but it truly is the worst chromebook on the market !####['laptop general', 'laptop design features']
picks up wireless signals weakly !####['laptop connectivity']
the screen flickers , freezes , and the machine even restarts itself on some occasions .####['display operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
the screen display isn ' t bright at all !####['display operation performance']
even the keyboard is fantastic .####['keyboard general']
overall , worst chromebook ever and i can ' t wait until it dies !####['laptop general']
i would not recommend this as a primary chromebook or even to buy it at all .####['laptop general']
update - this thing frustrated me so much over the past month that i just threw it in the trash ( where it belongs ) .####['laptop general']
personally , i would steer clear of this chromebook .####['laptop general']
it started to get slow a week ago .####['laptop operation performance']
now the curser / track pad is gone .####['hardware operation performance']
terrible product .####['laptop general']
if you use wix to edit websites the scroll bar will not appear once you enter editor page , thus making it impossible to design / build / update websites .####['software usability']
i was disappointed with the touch pad would stick and when it broke loose it over shot the target .####['keyboard operation performance']
do not buy this machine if you ' re hoping to run android apps .####['laptop usability']
after charging the unit for 2 hours i discovered that the unit will only operate while the charger is connected .####['laptop operation performance']
keys are a bit thin and have an odd feel to them .####['keyboard design features']
this unit is a great compromise between powerful cpu and gpu with good battery life .####['laptop general', 'graphics operation performance', 'cpu operation performance', 'battery general']
- timeout on keyboard backlight not adjustable .####['keyboard usability']
acer refused to pay for shipping it back to them for warranty repairs .####['support quality']
that seemed to correct problem , but problem returned next day and the battery would only charge up to 1 % with charger plugged in .####['battery operation performance']
monitor went out 35 days after receiving .####['display quality']
powered it down and back up a few time to check boot times and now ibhave huge black lines running down the screen .####['display operation performance']
display driver fails 3x a day .####['display quality']
loses wifi connection every hour .####['ports operation performance']
they are simply unreliable , poorly made laptops .####['laptop general']
its a hardware issue .####['hardware quality']
the picture was very bright and clear , the back - lit keyboard was a very nice feature , and it seemed like a good value for the price .####['laptop price', 'display quality', 'keyboard general']
the internet download speed with the acer was akin to an old dial - up modem speed .####['ports connectivity']
as of this writing , the computer ' s dedicated video card is completely non - functional , the computer routinely switches off in the middle of executing a process , and i can ' t even use the hdmi out port .####['ports general', 'multimedia devices general', 'laptop quality']
however with that being said i bought this laptop about 3 days ago and it ' s already not working .####['laptop operation performance']
i called acer tech support but nothing worked .####['support general']
will not recommend it .####['laptop general']
it is an ok laptop .####['laptop general']
the problem with it is that it freezes from time to time .####['laptop operation performance']
this looks too big , it ' s just 1 day of use so far this is my review .####['laptop design features']
my computer was used on average a couple hours a day .####['laptop general']
11 months after the purchase , it died .####['laptop general']
it worked great , no issues besides the mouse began to freeze when the computer was idled for too long .####['keyboard operation performance']
first one had a white line on the screen , then went and got a replacement , not even six months into this one and the graphics card failed .####['graphics general', 'display operation performance']
nice computer that came with a bad fan .####['laptop general', 'fans&cooling general']
the problem is a complete lack of local hardware support in the us unless you happen to live in temple , tx .####['support general']
i am giving this a one star because of its faulty design .####['laptop design features']
the screen sits too close to the keyboard and you will end up with scratches on the screen .####['keyboard design features']
laptop failed after only six months of use .####['laptop quality']
worked fine until 3 months after i bought it .####['laptop general']
laptop was working fine until just under 3 months of use when it bsod ' d and wouldn ' t turn back on .####['laptop operation performance']
looking past the bsod problem , the battery is internal so you can ' t just pop it off , you need access the mobo just to replace it .####['battery design features']
this laptop ' s construction is cheap and flimsy , the battery is not removable and the back case is nearly impossible to take off without damaging it .####['laptop design features', 'battery design features']
it would not start up after 2 months of purchase and then re - set button didn ' t work .####['laptop general', 'hardware general']
its a good computer for the price but it needs to work awhile without crashing within 6 months .####['laptop price']
the touchpad is quite sensitive i ' ve noticed , not a big issue to me .####['hardware operation performance']
i will keep my rating at 3 stars , as the issues with the screen quality / shine - and volume / brightness keys being unusable and nonexistent , to be large issues for me .####['laptop general', 'multimedia devices quality', 'display quality']
the laptop build is cheap looking and basic , but functional to say the least while i save up money .####['laptop operation performance', 'laptop quality']
i will say , however , that the screen is kind of awful .####['display quality']
it looks awful , feels awful .####['laptop design features']
overall i have to remind myself that this laptop is only 600 dollars , and with certain gains i ' ll lose some things unless i ' m willing to spend out of budget .####['laptop price']
this item is two months old and the power button repeatedly does not work .####['out of scope operation performance']
screen broke 2 weeks after having it .####['display quality']
i had this laptop repaired within the first 6 months of owning it .####['laptop general']
works good but right click on mouse pad wont wok have to use external mouse####['laptop operation performance']
when i play a game , there is noise on the screen .####['display operation performance']
the laptop itself seemed fine at first .####['laptop general']
but the backlit keyboard was no longer lighting - up and the computer would no longer turn - on or boot .####['keyboard operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
i left it plugged in to charge for the night and tried it again the next morning , with the same results of not being able to turn it back on .####['laptop general']
at this point i no longer trusted this model and was afraid of having the same issue with a replacement if i exchanged it , and then not having enough time to do another exchange and still be able to charge and configure it in time to wrap and put under the christmas tree for my son , so i contacted amazon and they gladly e - mailed me a return shipping label and refunded my money in full in 3 days , after receiving it back from me .####['laptop general', 'support general']
i hate to knock acer as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new product and then not being able to turn it on to use it .####['laptop general', 'company general']
then i called amazon - acer again , the customer service was good !####['support general']
overall this is a very capable machine , better life is great as well .####['laptop general', 'battery general']
not sure if this is simply a deal accident , but my ssd failed within 4 months .####['hard disc operation performance']
but the battery was giving erroneous feedback and getting too hot while charging , the keyboard was way too sensitive for me , and the cover / lid was a really cheaply made .####['battery operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance', 'hardware operation performance']
i got the computer working fine i set everything up linked it to my phone ect , then i had steam messages open , discord open and watching youtube and the screen again froze completely no audio no nothing just a frozen screen displaying youtube .####['display operation performance']
it had hard failure after a month and i had to send it our for a service .####['laptop operation performance']
power turning on failed .####['power supply operation performance']
computer wo n ' t turn on have had it less then a year .####['laptop operation performance']
the laptop died after just one month .####['laptop operation performance']
poor screen quality , extremely dim , lacks clarity , slow photo uploads .####['display quality', 'laptop operation performance']
received it , launched up a game , cpu reaches 99 degrees celsius , game crashes .####['cpu operation performance']
twice in 10 days i had an issue , pointer , where they said turn it over and put a pin in it .####['out of scope operation performance']
it ' s far too early in this machine ' s life to be encountering problems , the company has very poor customer service , and i would strongly recommend against purchasing .####['company general']
it works well , but the only thing i don ' t like about it is that it makes it extremely difficult to find things that i ' m looking for .####['laptop usability', 'laptop operation performance']
the computer hold its ground , but it has specs to be a killer .####['laptop general']
barely have it for 6 months and everything ' s going haywire .####['laptop general']
now i ca n ' t even get into my laptop because the startup is all jacked up .####['laptop general']
however , the 1 - star review is due to the advertising with the computer .####['laptop general']
battery is not as long####['battery operation performance']
buyer beware - computer is complete trash .####['laptop general']
it just freezes up on you .####['laptop operation performance']
super off balance with respect to screen .####['display general']
keyboard lighting is primitive and keeps shutting off .####['keyboard design features']
the battery life is around 2 hrs , not 10 + as advertised .####['battery operation performance']
i have had good luck with acer products but this pc was my 1st time i needed them for technical support .####['laptop general']
i call acer support and after an hour they can not help me .####['support quality']
bought an acer computer that did not work .####['laptop usability']
i ' ve called apple support numerous times and was never asked if i had the ability to read words as i ' m actually reading words .####['support general']
thank you to amazon for taking this brick of acer garbage back .####['laptop general', 'company general']
could have been a great computer if not for the terrible keyboard construction .####['laptop general', 'keyboard quality']
constantly got the blue screen , already tryed everything to fix it .####['laptop operation performance']
the seller doesn ' t reply my e - mails####['support quality']
i ' ve had this for 3 days and so far the laptop is fine .####['laptop general']
i ' m seriously considering returning it !####['laptop general']
i don ' t want bluetooth speakers .####['multimedia devices general']
i would not buy this again !####['laptop general']
good touchpad####['hardware general']
below medium build quality####['laptop quality']
usb ports are too hard to plug and unplug####['ports usability']
comes with hdd and this makes this laptop very slow####['laptop operation performance', 'hard disc operation performance']
about 4 hours of battery####['battery operation performance']
maintenance and opening case is too hard####['laptop usability']
in contrast of that , this laptop ' s cpu is very powerful .####['cpu operation performance']
on the other hand , it is not an easy task to open and replace hdd .####['hard disc design features']
i don ' t understand this kind of design .####['laptop design features']
i can enjoy the real potential of this laptop .####['laptop operation performance']
1 ) the delete button is right next to the power button####['keyboard design features']
2 ) slow start up and performance given####['laptop operation performance']
it ' s fast at processing , fast for web browsing and has a quick startup .####['laptop operation performance']
in seconds , even with an hdd it ' s still starts up in seconds .####['hard disc general', 'laptop operation performance']
the fingerprint sensor is a nice touch and the color and feel of the laptop material is also nice .####['hardware operation performance', 'laptop design features']
there is really no excuse why it can ' t have one .####['laptop design features']
it has the specs but that ' s it ' s main downfall .####['laptop general']
15 ` ` screen , full sized keyboard and speed fast enough for some low quality games such as lol .####['keyboard design features', 'laptop operation performance']
it ' s light and thin , and overall the screen is pretty good .####['display general', 'laptop design features']
the hdd that comes with the computer is slow and loud , in fact the computer is not usable by todays standard , it ' s terribly slow .####['laptop usability']
after the ssd upgrade , the computer is very fast .####['hard disc operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
the build quality is cheap .####['laptop quality']
everything is plastic .####['laptop design features']
the hard drive sounds like a distant lawn mower .####['hard disc operation performance']
this thing is slow !####['laptop operation performance']
i ' m trying to do online college college courses with it and it gets hung up in some intimate nevernever land of unresponsiveness .####['laptop operation performance']
- the audio for this laptop was poorly planned out .####['multimedia devices design features']
so the audio can easily be muffled .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
- even so those are forgivable offenses compared to the next and worst thing , the touchpad .####['hardware general']
this laptop ' s tocuhpad is by far the worst i have ever used .####['hardware general']
i bought 2 , one stopped working after 9 months , was sent for ` ` repair ` ` it wasn ' t came right back with the same issue .####['laptop quality']
the other one had the same issue after 9 months of use , wasn ' t used right away when purchased .####['laptop quality']
the customer service is the worst i have ever experienced , asking the same questions over and over , not helpful at all .####['support general']
do not buy !####['laptop general']
today tried to turned it on , but to a blank screen !####['laptop operation performance']
this is a painfully slow computer .####['laptop operation performance']
- acceptable amount of flex####['laptop design features']
- fingerprint reader is working well####['hardware operation performance']
- track pad is accurate####['hardware operation performance']
- screen looks good####['display design features']
- took literally 5 + hours for windows update / setup####['os operation performance']
- the webcam is a bad joke####['multimedia devices general']
the hard drive is definitely slow .####['hard disc operation performance']
after only a little over a month , it totally died and will not work at all .####['laptop quality']
i love asus but this one is super slow !####['laptop operation performance', 'company general']
extremely slow .####['laptop operation performance']
very junky####['laptop general']
sound went out in less than a week .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
this item cost me money .####['laptop general']
after running through the setup wizard , the laptop failed to boot .####['laptop operation performance']
though it is competitively priced for the specs , the laptop felt cheap .####['laptop price', 'laptop quality']
i eventually returned it .####['laptop general']
ordered in november 2017 but used fewer than 100 hours when vertical red line appeared on monitor .####['display quality']
they are clearly working with more than one person at a time , and not effective multi - taskers .####['support general']
laptop screen goes blank after four weeks minimally used .####['display operation performance']
then it would not boot up .####['laptop operation performance']
screen turn black and won ' t turn on within a month rarely use .####['display quality']
- excellent cpu####['cpu general']
- good ram####['memory general']
then the light bleed becomes annoying and distracting .####['display operation performance']
- the hard drive is really slow and really loud .####['hard disc operation performance']
overall : the specs for this computer looked pretty good , but after using it for a few weeks , the negatives outweigh the positives , and i ' m going to have to return it .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
beware this product seems to have no quality control .####['laptop quality']
i was using it and the screen started to flicker and then went completely dim .####['display operation performance']
also tech support gave incorrect product info !####['support general']
it ' s a good enough laptop .####['laptop general']
customer service told me it ' s faulty####['support general']
power plug doesn ' t fit well - connection is erratic .####['power supply connectivity']
the vivobook f510ua is a great laptop with fantastic specs .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features']
however i ' m happy to report that the keyboard is great and i ' ve already gotten use to it .####['keyboard general']
with my first day of use everything was terribly slow and updates took hours .####['laptop operation performance']
be prepared to wait a good five hours give or take until the system runs smoother .####['os operation performance']
2 ssd as it will not fit the slot available .####['hard disc design features']
2 stars taken for horrible sound quality####['multimedia devices quality']
this computer completely shut down after 2 months .####['laptop quality']
i can ' t get it to work at all .####['laptop operation performance']
it ' s one of the worst laptops i ' ve ever had .####['laptop general']
this is junk .####['laptop general']
it is going on 3 hours now and is only 17 % done .####['os operation performance']
the item is good but the sound of speakers is very low .####['laptop general', 'multimedia devices operation performance']
otherwise , it has everything i can / might / could love .####['laptop general']
my only other complaint is trackpad sensitivity .####['hardware operation performance']
having win 10 is already a horrible mistake as so , but if you try to install win 8 , drivers won ' t work properly !####['os operation performance']
this computer freeze , reboots , and crashes in a regular basis if you ' re trying to do multiple stuff at once .####['laptop operation performance']
screen maximum brightness is still not bright enough####['display operation performance']
two stars because the current laptop i have works great .####['laptop operation performance']
it felt flimsy , but decent .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features']
very slow , and always hangs####['laptop operation performance']
it ' s a pretty good laptop .####['laptop general']
nicely sized , thin and portable , the works .####['laptop portability', 'laptop design features']
the only issue i ' m having is battery life .####['battery operation performance']
thing says 8 hours , but i can guarantee it ' s not making it past 4 or 5 .####['battery operation performance']
but yeah overall good####['laptop general']
it runs pretty fast but the keyboard is not lit , the speakers are on the bottom and the track pad is a pos .####['multimedia devices design features', 'hardware general', 'keyboard design features', 'laptop operation performance']
besides that it runs ok####['laptop operation performance']
update - dead pixel in middle screen .####['display quality']
replacement ordered and arrived , upon first ten minutes of use the keyboard stops working and is barely functioning sound on max is extremely undesirable .####['keyboard quality']
second update - speakers no longer work after 1 month of use .####['multimedia devices quality']
runs ok , cheapish , good for price i guess####['laptop price', 'laptop operation performance']
the battery broke after just 4 months from baying it am so disappointed with the product####['laptop general', 'battery quality']
do not buy this laptop .####['laptop general']
i returned it twice .####['laptop general']
and when it did work it was very slow .####['laptop operation performance']
windows 10 alone runs slow on this but once you install some 3rd party programs like adobe photoshop or illistrator , this laptop is unuseable .####['os operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
even having a couple of programs open & running , slows down the overall performance of the system dramatically .####['os operation performance']
i ' ve been waiting for this chromebook for some time now and having only had it for about two weeks , i can say that the device and purchase were well worth it .####['laptop general']
5 ` ` ips screen that is gorgeous to look at , extremely bright and full 1080p resolution .####['display design features']
a solid little m3 processor , 4gb of ram and 64gb of ssd storage make this machine capable of handling heavy usage and earn it a solid octane 2 .####['memory operation performance', 'hard disc operation performance']
the surface texture of the case is a satiny paper - like touch , which is both clean and easy to wipe down , but also not so smooth that you have to be concerned with it slipping out of your hand when carrying it .####['laptop usability', 'laptop design features']
even with the 2 - in - 1 flip hinge , the device has a solid feel and there ' s very little wobble in the screen while typing .####['display usability']
the pop - up keyboard looks just like the android screen keyboard and the orientation detection and capacitive touch screen are snappy and very responsive .####['display operation performance']
one place that does frustrate me in the tablet mode is that chromeos has a number of ui features that don ' t lend themselves to touch interaction .####['os design features']
it has a glassy - smooth surface that resists finger - prints and goop , is very large , and has a firm but not too - clunky feeling click to it .####['display design features']
it takes up more than 1 / 3rd of the palm - area horizontal space and makes thumb - tapping mouse tweaks very easy .####['display design features']
finally , there are the ports .####['ports general']
- beautiful , bright ips screen with full 1080p resolution####['display design features']
- backlit keyboard rocks####['keyboard design features']
- battery life is pretty amazing at 10 - 11hrs####['battery operation performance']
- 4gb ram cap .####['memory operation performance']
- many ui elements are not user - friendly in tablet mode####['os operation performance']
- port minimalism .####['ports portability']
out of the box , the asus c302ca is a powerhouse for stock chromeos usage .####['laptop general']
performance - wise , i can easily have 12 - 24 tabs open simultaneously and see no slow - down in performance .####['os operation performance']
one place that i find lacking in chromeos is the settings management .####['os design features']
for the most - part you don ' t have much freedom to make any significant changes to settings .####['software design features']
- clean and secure operating system that is very lean and gets the most out of the systems modest specs####['os design features']
- with the combination of web - based productivity tools and development apps / services , this chromebook can provide a breadth of very viable usage scenarios without bogging the system down with locally install applications .####['laptop operation performance']
- android apps and google play store are real game changers for the chromeos landscape .####['software general']
- boot time , sleep time and wake time are crazy fast .####['os quality']
- system settings could be more robust and better organized####['os design features']
- tablet - mode still needs some work .####['laptop operation performance']
so , this is where this little chromebook really shines .####['laptop general']
apps start very fast , graphics are much more responsive and capable when not being shared with chromeos and there are a number of ways you can tweak the ui / ux to your own liking .####['graphics usability']
all that being said , you get a lot of bang for the buck with these three enhanced desktop / application options and i use all three in some capacity every day , so don ' t think your ' e isolated to just one approach .####['software general']
while the stock aluminum case is darn solid enough , it can take scratches easily from things like keys or cable connectors tossed in a bag with it .####['laptop quality']
d ) a bluetooth mouse - while this unarguably has one of the best trackpads in chromebook land , there are still times you just need the precision of a mouse .####['hardware general']
0 type - a low - profile memory stick on a usb - c adaptor , but that would be silly .####['ports general']
it was an excellent machine for the money and it also got me spoiled with its touch screen .####['laptop price', 'display operation performance']
this made me realize that arm processors are not ready for desktop - class browsing .####['cpu general']
let me tell you , this thing is snappy .####['laptop operation performance']
the build quality is nice and the hinge is sturdy .####['hardware quality', 'laptop quality']
the keyboard also feels nice and the backlighting is great .####['keyboard general']
i use my chromebook a lot in the dark and it ' s a real treat .####['laptop usability']
while the chromebook pro does have a nice high - resolution 3 : 2 screen and the s - pen ( which is truly a gimmick anyway ) , it has half the storage , shorter battery life , and no backlit keyboard .####['memory design features', 'battery operation performance', 'keyboard design features']
this is among the best .####['laptop general']
it ' s much smoother with web pages and android apps , and the touch screen is more responsive .####['display operation performance', 'software operation performance']
keyboard is a bit nicer , not tons .####['keyboard general']
for casual use , this will work fine for me .####['laptop general']
the default scaling 1536x864 looks excellent and sharp to me .####['display operation performance']
there ' s nothing i do n ' t like about this device , so in order of importance , here ' s what i love about it .####['laptop general']
i ' m typing this review in a dark room , and it reminds me how much i love this backlit keyboard .####['keyboard operation performance']
i love how quick this thing is .####['cpu operation performance']
this thing is n ' t that fast , but for loading web pages , it ' s pretty close .####['cpu operation performance']
the brightness and clarity are awesome .####['display operation performance']
this is quality hardware , and it shows .####['hardware quality']
it ' s complementary , not revolutionary , which is much more intuitive and useful .####['laptop general']
again , this is where the build quality really shines .####['laptop quality']
the microsd slot leaves an inserted card perfectly flush .####['ports operation performance']
this flip 2 really is a fantastic chromebook , and the ability to run android apps only makes it better !####['laptop general', 'software operation performance']
i absolutely love this beyond any computer / tablet device i have purchased in the last 10 years , trust me , i ' ve bought a lot of them along the way .####['laptop general']
with the power of the internet and all the online productivity products the simplicity of this is fantastic .####['laptop usability']
the addition of the play store puts the device into a sweet spot no other device can come close to matching .####['laptop design features']
this asus chromebook fits the bill .####['laptop general']
can ' t say enough about my love of this chromebook .####['laptop general']
then the asus flip c302 came into my life :####['laptop general']
speaking of charges , it ' s so nice to be able to use usb c .####['ports general']
our phones are usb c so one cable does everything for me .####['ports general']
* keyboard * - the keyboard is alright .####['keyboard general']
* track pad * - the trackpad is well done .####['keyboard design features']
80 % of the apps it ' s a poor experience .####['software quality']
the asus c302 is the best chromebook you can buy .####['laptop general']
the touch screen is super responsive and the keyboard is excellent .####['display operation performance', 'keyboard general']
it runs most of those apps and games beautifully and when combined with a ` ` logitech gamepad f310 ` ` you can play the games with a game controller !####['software operation performance']
overall this is a home run purchase and i can ' t say enough good things about the asus c302 .####['laptop general']
i mostly use it for playing a couple of games , surfing the web , managing my calendar / tasks lists , reading e - books , that sort of thing .####['laptop operation performance']
the keyboard is small , a little weird and takes some getting used to .####['keyboard design features']
the keyboard is excellent ( and backlit ) .####['keyboard general']
the track pad is excellent .####['keyboard general']
the screen is excellent .####['display general']
this laptop performs in every way .####['laptop operation performance']
it ' s light , but also has a good weight to it .####['laptop design features']
- the touchscreen is very responsive , fast , and so far everything has scaled just fine during use####['hardware operation performance']
- the hinges are just perfect .####['hardware general']
- the speakers are to the sides and not underneath so the sound isn ' t muffled when it ' s resting on something other than a flat surface####['multimedia devices design features']
- this chromebook has access to the android beta channel for android apps####['laptop design features']
and because of the constant usage of higher brightness , the battery does drain faster .####['battery operation performance']
they both pick up oils and such pretty easily .####['display operation performance']
as for the asus , it is a wonderful laptop .####['laptop general']
i have had no issues with the track pad ; it works fine .####['keyboard operation performance']
i have not fully tested battery life but it seems to last about as long as advertised .####['battery operation performance']
one , the display is gorgeous ; watching video is a treat .####['display operation performance']
however , there is screen glare , even in a normally lit room , not just a brightly lit room .####['display operation performance']
i think that the bezels are a smidge thick , but that actually makes perfect sense .####['hardware design features']
it ' s a real treat .####['laptop general']
my use experience has been riddled with lag and jitteriness , although using the touchscreen for a moment sorts everything out .####['hardware operation performance']
the speakers get plenty loud , but they start to sound pretty bad when turned up a little past half volume .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
the core m3 allows this system to get fast and to stay quiet .####['cpu operation performance']
sometimes , under heavy loads , the bottom of the c302 gets warm to the touch , but not to the point of pain .####['fans&cooling quality']
all the while , it provides one of the fastest web browsing experiences that i ' ve ever experienced .####['software operation performance']
it will take years of bad programming to make this chromebook as slow as my last one got .####['laptop operation performance']
2 ) the touchpad is way too wonky - asus needs to fix this asap .####['hardware operation performance']
having had it for just over a month , i have to say i am thoroughly impressed by its versatility and how stable the os is .####['os operation performance']
on a side note , there is a slight defect on my chromebook as there is some creaking and loose feeling when pressing on the bottom left side of my screen , this can be especially annoying in tablet mode .####['display quality', 'laptop quality']
boot up is of course , almost instant .####['os operation performance']
- excellent keyboard in all aspects - feel , rigidity , and backlight####['keyboard general']
- excellent build quality - aluminium case is solid and has a premium feel####['laptop quality']
- perfect balance of speed and battery life####['battery operation performance']
- my only real gripe is that i wish it was .####['laptop design features']
other than my hope that it would be light enough to use as a tablet all the time , this is the chromebook i ' ve been wanting for a long time now .####['laptop portability']
it ' s extremely useful as a laptop as well as , most of the time at least , a tablet .####['laptop usability']
note : i bought a refurbished / ` ` damaged ` ` model from amazon and it ' s in absolutely flawless condition .####['laptop general']
pros : lightweight , fast , portable , great battery life ( 12 .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance', 'battery general']
the keyboard and mouse on the asus were frequently rated as good but those on the pixelbook were raved about .####['mouse general']
the side mounted speakers are clear .####['multimedia devices quality']
the battery life is not anywhere near the advertised 8 hours .####['battery operation performance']
the design and style is topnotch .####['laptop design features']
boot speed : likewise , very fast -####['os operation performance']
many android apps work conditionally : e .####['software operation performance']
battery life is phenomenal again .####['battery operation performance']
the keyboard is fully sized and comfortable , the key travel is good with great action , backlighting is enough and adaptive .####['keyboard quality', 'keyboard design features', 'keyboard operation performance']
- the aluminum build is firm and solid without feeling cheap .####['laptop quality']
- the screen is great in all aspects .####['display general']
- performance is solid for chromebook use .####['laptop operation performance']
- battery life is great .####['battery general']
everything is either good or excellent in quality .####['laptop quality']
- screen brightness is generally ` ` enough ` ` but maybe not enough for watching dark movies in bright lights .####['display operation performance']
- speakers can ` ` chatter ` ` after playing youtube videos for a long period of time .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
- performance can be stuttering when under heavy load .####['laptop operation performance']
again , overall i believe this is a great laptop with an amazing keyboard .####['laptop general', 'keyboard general']
- i was worried that because the chromebooks are internet based it would run slow , but so far it is very fast at processing , installing , and uploading things .####['laptop operation performance']
- physically it is appealing looking .####['laptop design features']
this is smart looking , thin , light weight , and portable .####['laptop portability', 'laptop design features']
but , it was packed well and arrived with no damage whatsoever !####['shipping quality']
the one annoyance is that office 365 doesn ' t provide a seamless way to save file offline and sync up when you ' re online .####['software design features']
- the keyboard is great and has a nice gentle / quiet click to it .####['keyboard usability', 'keyboard general']
- the keys themselves don ' t travel that much which i prefer .####['keyboard usability']
- the trackpad , while a little on the small size , has a nice glass smooth finish and it works reliable well .####['keyboard design features', 'keyboard operation performance']
- the touchscreen works great and is very responsive .####['display operation performance']
- the build quality is great but not necessarily impressive .####['laptop quality']
tablet works just fine though .####['laptop operation performance']
build quality and design are top notch .####['laptop design features', 'laptop quality']
i absolutely love this chromebook !####['laptop general']
so , i originally purchased this for the travel conveniences .####['laptop portability']
most of my love for this laptop is based on the operating system but since you get that with every chromebook , i ' ll tell you what i like and dislike about the physical laptop only .####['os operation performance']
the display is perfect for me , plenty of brightness and a decent resolution .####['display general', 'display design features']
the usb - c ports are nice and i found that a completely dead battery to fully charged time was about an hour .####['ports general', 'power supply operation performance']
i really liked that this chromebook came with 64gb of space but i really don ' t see how someone may fill that up unless they opt to sync their google drive offline or something .####['laptop general']
i wish the display was able to go about 1 or 2 clicks brighter and about 1 click darker at the lowest setting .####['display design features']
the speaker volume is decent but the quality of sound is terrible .####['multimedia devices quality', 'multimedia devices general']
the keyboard is awesome .####['keyboard design features']
- it ' s a bit heavy in tablet mode .####['laptop portability']
- i wish the sound quality was better .####['multimedia devices general']
despite these cons i think this was a great purchase .####['laptop general']
performance wise , this is an excellent machine - it has a beautiful touchscreen , plenty of storage , converts to a tablet , and seamlessly connects to the google play store to run any of the millions of android apps available .####['memory design features', 'display design features']
the customer / warranty service that i received was first class and i am very impressed by asus for this reason alone .####['support quality', 'laptop general']
if you are in need of a reliable laptop that is lightweight , fast , and convertible , i highly recommend the asus c302 !####['laptop general', 'laptop design features', 'laptop usability']
i loved the simplicity of chrome os while enjoying the flip aspect of being able to turn it into a reading tablet when i wanted to as well .####['laptop design features']
this time around , asus released an absolutely refined masterpiece .####['company general']
the c302 is heavier in size and appearance and also significantly better in all aspects .####['laptop design features']
the keyboard traction is clicky and the layout is spaced out well enough for a terrific typing experience .####['keyboard operation performance']
the premium feel combined with the charming simplicity of chrome os really gives it a stunning experience .####['os operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
so i decided to purchase the asus flip , and so far it has met every one of my nitpicky demanding needs .####['laptop general']
build quality is very good , nearing the ` ` excellent ` ` mark , especially for the price .####['laptop price', 'laptop quality']
sound has been fine , except for a few issues with an android app , and that can easily be software related as android is still in infant stages ( or at least toddler ) on chromebooks , and i expect those quirks will smooth out over time as chromebook software is updated on a very regular basis .####['software operation performance']
the keyboard is very nice for me .####['keyboard general']
android is running flawlessly so far , barring one minor incident with sound on clash of clans ( which went away on reboot ) .####['software operation performance']
the m3 processor is fast and fluid .####['cpu operation performance']
and the backlit keyboard has a very good feel , and great key ` ` travel . ` `####['keyboard usability']
despite the minor case marks , i can heartily recommend this chromebook based on features , design , and operation .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
great product build - the quality of this asus chromebook is impressive at any price , but at sub - $ 500 it ' s astounding .####['laptop price', 'laptop design features', 'laptop quality']
the metal case is really well built , and the fit and finish are virtually perfect .####['laptop quality']
that said just buy it with confidence , it ' s a top quality product all around , and , it looks and feels that way .####['laptop quality']
the keyboard and touchpad experience are pivotal for a device like this and what asus delivers is very satisfying .####['company general']
the back - lit keyboard is a joy to use and the 1920 x 1080 touchscreen is superb .####['keyboard usability', 'display general']
this chromebook is light - weight , durable and beautiful .####['laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
the 360 - degree hinges allow me to make presentations to customers and the battery life is amazing .####['laptop general', 'battery general']
this little guy fits the bill perfectly .####['laptop operation performance']
the touch screen is nice , and i like to use it for free handing things when i need to .####['display general']
this chrome book joins the group and is itself excellent and different .####['laptop general']
the keyboard is good .####['keyboard general']
the screen is bright and color spread is good .####['display operation performance']
fast , beautiful display , comfortable keyboard , and the android apps work well ( not great yet , but well ) .####['keyboard usability', 'software operation performance', 'display design features']
sorry for the ` ` downer ` ` start here , because as a chromebook , the c302 is very good .####['laptop general']
the c302 m5 ( the best processor i could find so far , is a very good chromebook .####['laptop general', 'cpu general']
still , a very nice compact chromebook .####['laptop general']
it has a light design making it easy for travel , reasonably small screen that makes it easy to use on your lap or in class , and a quality chassis to give it that nice premium feeling almost like a shiny apple mac .####['laptop usability', 'laptop portability', 'laptop design features', 'display design features']
the biggest benefit with this computer for me is the longevity of the battery life with this thing .####['battery operation performance']
* very solidly built and it transitions nicely from laptop to tablet mode .####['laptop design features', 'laptop quality']
it feels very nice and i also really like the backlit keys in the dark .####['laptop general', 'keyboard general']
* the screen is more than adequate for me , although i have not used it outside much yet .####['display usability']
* battery - i can not really speak to the battery life yet , but as a power user with lots of tabs and several apps open , it is giving me a days use 5 + hours of use so far .####['battery operation performance']
it is working really well .####['laptop operation performance']
surprisingly to me , the tablet form has been better than expected for reading .####['laptop operation performance']
in laptop mode the trackpad works very well for this .####['hardware operation performance']
the sound is not real loud from the speakers , but i am reasonably pleased with the quality .####['multimedia devices quality']
it ' s one of the best chromebook in the market if not the best .####['laptop general']
speed : it ' s very fast .####['laptop operation performance']
keybooard : keyboard is good .####['keyboard general']
trackbad : it could be better but it ' s not bad 8 .####['keyboard general']
the batrey charges very quickly , you will need 1 hour for a full charge .####['power supply operation performance']
the coolest thing is the touch screen on something this size .####['display design features']
so far , netflix has been the most useful for me .####['software general']
i love my c302 !####['laptop general']
it ' s the perfect size and , like you said , the keyboard is one of the best i ' ve ever laid my hands on .####['laptop design features', 'keyboard general']
the build quality is great .####['laptop quality']
it travels well , great battery life , and is powerful enough for 100 % of the tasks i need to do ( web , streaming , word processing , reports , email ) .####['battery operation performance', 'laptop operation performance']
chrome is also a great os - fast and so convenient especially if you rely on docs , sheets , google drive , etc .####['os operation performance']
this chromebook is amazing .####['laptop general']
this chromebook features a full size keyboard and is easier type on by a long shot .####['keyboard design features', 'keyboard operation performance']
it has a very fast 64gb ssd and 4gb on lpddr3 memory .####['memory operation performance', 'hard disc operation performance']
it is a fanless processor so there are no vents or openings of any kind which makes this exceptionally quiet as well .####['cpu design features']
the device is very light and easily transportable .####['laptop portability', 'laptop design features']
speaking of asus flip itself - it is great in every way !####['laptop general']
i am not a techie , all i can say as user - this chromebook is fast , it lasts and weighs very little .####['laptop operation performance']
the unit is sturdy and the screen is excellent .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features']
bluetooth to an external speaker is do - able , but not convenient .####['multimedia devices connectivity']
note : my first one arrived with a crushed speaker screen on one side , though the packaging was unmolested .####['multimedia devices quality']
this is a wonderful device .####['laptop general']
i ' m no expert on screens but i personally think the panel looks very nice .####['display design features']
battery life appears good but will depend on your brightness and how much streaming your doing .####['battery operation performance']
i was able to charge it quite rapidly with the usb - c charger and was about fully charged in an hour .####['power supply operation performance']
boot time is basically non - existent .####['os operation performance']
the touch screen works quite well and i have found myself watching videos in tablet mode with ease .####['display operation performance']
it has non existent boot times and updates are easy .####['os usability', 'os operation performance']

i don ' t know that i would want to use for work but it ' s perfect for personal use .####['laptop general']
the screen is great , the computer is fast , and looks great with the aluminum case .####['display general', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance']
openvpn support needs some serious work still .####['support design features']
don ' t get me wrong though , i love the battery life and 95 % i ' m happy chugging along , but every once in a while this rears it ' s ugly head .####['laptop general', 'battery general']
the keyboard is really nice - .####['keyboard general']
this chromebook works like a dream .####['laptop operation performance']
note : i haven ' t had any issues with the touchscreen at all .####['display quality']
i used to use a ridiculously heavy d _ _ _ inspirion , which i love because of the 17 ` ` screen and capabilities , but i quickly found that carrying it anywhere caused my shoulders and back to hurt !####['laptop usability', 'display general']
i love , love , love this computer .####['laptop general']
big screen !####['display design features']
sound sort of sucks but i don ' t use it for music .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
android aspect is no longer ` ` beta , ` ` and gotten / still getting better .####['software general']
the keyboard and display quality have always been asus strengths in my experience .####['display quality']
the touchpad is not the best , but it is not that terrible either .####['keyboard general']
i am not fond of touchpads anyway , so probably not the best one to judge them .####['keyboard general']
but as it stands still makes a great mobile device with excellent battery life to boot .####['laptop general', 'battery general']
this chromebook is great system that is lightweight , has excellent battery life , and offers a fantastic keyboard .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features', 'keyboard general', 'battery general']

it ' s very crisp and responsive .####['keyboard operation performance']
the speakers are surprisingly decent .####['multimedia devices general']

its fast , battery lasts for many hours , all the apps work well , the wifi on this is great , and the screen resolution is really great .####['battery operation performance', 'laptop connectivity', 'laptop operation performance', 'display design features', 'software operation performance']

nice back lit keyboard , i like the screen , but in the end , it is the software that counts .####['display general', 'keyboard general', 'software general']
i ' m a decent size ( 5 ' 11 ` ` 230lb ) with stubby fingers and proportionate hands .####['laptop design features']

it ' s an easy one for me : the 302 offers a better experience overall and it ' s not close .####['laptop quality']
love the feel and quality of this chromebook .####['laptop quality']

so far , this chromebook is fantastic .####['laptop general']
it served my needs of web browsing and word processing for a number of years , but its battery life had dwindled and neither the screen nor the processor can match this asus .####['display general', 'cpu general', 'battery general']
it boots in seconds , and i get ~ 10 hours out of the battery .####['battery operation performance', 'os operation performance']

lightweight , gorgeous , great screen / picture quaity , sound could be louder but still good , fast processor ( i do a lot of research , photo processing , netflix watching and reading on the laptop ) .####['laptop design features', 'cpu operation performance', 'multimedia devices general']
pros : light - sensor back - lit keyboard , great battery , fast startup , average - student friendly####['os operation performance', 'keyboard design features', 'battery general']
cons : no caps lock key ( still haven ' t found it , help ! )####['keyboard design features']
i purchased this machine on cyber monday for $ 375 ( $ 75 off the listing price at the time of this review ) and i think at that price point , it ' s well worth it .####['laptop quality']
the startup time is ridiculously fast , and just opening the laptop will turn it on and get you going on chrome within 10 seconds - i ' ve had as many as 12 tabs open , and it still ran smoothly .####['os operation performance', 'software operation performance']
the battery life is a huge selling point in my opinion : even after multiple shut - downs / start - ups throughout the day , i get about 10 hours total run - time , and charging only takes about an hour .####['battery operation performance', 'power supply operation performance']
all in all , this is a great laptop for the casual user , especially at this price point .####['laptop miscellaneous']
if you want to watch movies or listen to music , this might not be the machine for you .####['laptop operation performance']
the key features that drew me to this chromebook was design , a quality keyboard that had backlit keys , and a good processor .####['cpu general', 'keyboard quality']
i did not find the battery to last a full ten hours .####['battery operation performance']
however , it charges insanely quickly : you can get a full charge in under an hour .####['power supply operation performance']
the touchscreen is great though and feels very intuitive .####['display general']
keyboard is fantastic .####['keyboard general']

and the price is excellent for what you get .####['laptop price']
i ' ve been using this for a couple of weeks and i must say i am very very pleased with the product .####['laptop general']
- great quality build .####['laptop quality']
- 360 degrees flipping is actually pretty practical####['laptop design features']
- backlit and solid keyboard ( not flimsy or cheap )####['keyboard design features']
- touch screen is very accurate####['display general']
- side buttons are responsive and well - made####['hardware operation performance', 'hardware design features']
- battery life is a bit short after some gaming####['battery operation performance']

the m3 processor is pretty good ( decent speedometer score ) .####['cpu general']
the body of the chromebook feels solid due to the aluminium body .####['laptop design features']

overall a good chromebook .####['laptop general']
outside of that , the keyboard is solid , the back lighting was not a selling point to me .####['keyboard design features']
the speakers overall are not very good .####['multimedia devices general']
track pad is passable .####['keyboard general']
screen is nice .####['display general']
i find it to be a little large when used in tablet mode .####['laptop design features']
overall , i am happy with it and would purchase it again .####['laptop general']
i tried the unit at best buy and to be honest , it felt a bit flimsy as a laptop .####['laptop general']
the keyboard is awkward to the touch and the internals only has 32gb of hard drive .####['hard disc design features', 'keyboard design features']
the sound isn ' t great on both devices but they ' ll suffice ; at least the asus speakers are side - firing and not coming from the bottom like the pro .####['multimedia devices design features']
so far i absolutely love it .####['laptop general']
love how fast it is , love that it can do everything i ' ve asked it to do so far in the two weeks i ' ve owned it , and i love how compact and easy it is to carry around .####['laptop portability', 'laptop operation performance']
it greatly exceeded my expectations .####['laptop general']
pro ' s : this chromebook is very light .####['laptop design features']
i don ' t know why google print is so touchy .####['software operation performance']
the second is also a known trouble spot with android , and that is the microsd card .####['out of scope general']
overall excellent machine , great keyboard & trackpad , very fast , battery lasts for hours , but know what you ' re getting into with chrome os .####['laptop general', 'battery operation performance', 'hardware general']
this is a capable chromebook !####['laptop general']
this asus chromebook c302ca does not skip a beat .####['laptop operation performance']
this is a good product based on my experience - i have used this for almost a whole month .####['laptop general']
the asus flip is perfect for me .####['laptop general']
so i went ahead and ordered the c302ca , and after a week of use there are no issues to report .####['laptop general']
i guess like anything else nothing will always be perfect , and so far this chromebook is everything i hoped for .####['laptop general']
for anyone wanting a small footprint 1080p chromebook , this one is hard to beat .####['laptop general']
i ' m loving this thing .####['laptop general']
superb quality , looks and feels like apple , keyboard is great , the touchpad is flawless and the screen is brilliant , battery life is great too .####['keyboard general', 'battery general', 'display general', 'laptop quality', 'hardware operation performance']
yet , compare with other flip - style of chromebooks , the screen is sufficient for me to do my code .####['display usability']
the biggest reason for me to pick this laptop over others is the light - weight design and its overall spec .####['laptop design features']
i like it , good construction , can load android apps .####['laptop design features']
the main complaints are the touch screen .####['display general']
i am a big chromebook enthusiast , and this is by far the best chromebook built to date .####['laptop general']

chrome os is intuitive and easy to use .####['os usability']
this little silver bullet is compact , functional , and has held up to everything i ' ve thrown at it .####['laptop operation performance']
chrome extensions are great productivity tools to boot - they help me squeeze the most out of everyday .####['software general']
the reason for a 4 star rating is due to the provided power cord failing to charge within two months .####['power supply operation performance']
the speakers are not great , but bluetooth connection to an external speaker is standard these days and it ' s how we watch movies .####['ports connectivity']
extremely disappointed that you can not run android apps on this chromebook , despite the description stating clearly that you can , and the seller responding to my question regarding this question .####['support general']
other than that i ' m pleased with the performance .####['laptop general']
this chromebook is amazing , i have had zero issues with it thus far and i ' ve used it quite extensively during the semester .####['laptop general']
the keyboard on this thing is my favorite part of the computer .####['laptop general', 'keyboard general']
it feels amazing and the travel is perfect .####['keyboard portability', 'laptop operation performance']
this biggest weak point and my only major complaint is that the speakers on it just suck .####['multimedia devices general']
they are loud enough to fill a small , quiet room , but that is about it .####['multimedia devices operation performance']
overall , i am very happy with this purchase , and i am in love with the simplicity of the google ecosystem .####['laptop general', 'out of scope usability']
this battery lasts for 5 + hours on some of the most taxing apps my phone can run .####['battery operation performance']
the pic quality is pretty good , though not 4k , the sound is pretty good for a laptop that is less than a half inch thick and weighs less than 3 pounds .####['multimedia devices general']
the touchscreen is great and the backlit keyboard is fantastic .####['display general', 'keyboard general']
asus is a great computer company .####['company general']
while i hate that it doesn ' t have a caps key , so i have to keep using the shift key to capitalize my letters , the device itself is lightweight , has a very nice backlit keyboard , and works well for the purposes of taking it on the road and using it with wifi at your local coffeeshop .####['laptop design features', 'keyboard general', 'laptop operation performance']
the aluminum construction is every bit as nice as my 12 ` ` macbook , the keyboard is excellent and has better travel / feedback and the trackpad is the best i ' ve used on any asus portable .####['laptop portability', 'hardware general', 'keyboard general']

this is my first chromebook , and i ' m absolutely loving it .####['laptop general']

this unit is extremely well built .####['laptop design features']

the keyboard is spacious , and has a nice tactile feel .####['keyboard design features', 'keyboard operation performance']
running android apps themselves are a pretty ` ` meh ` ` experience .####['software operation performance']
games are hit and miss .####['software general']
as far as a chromebook device this is the chromebook to get in early 2017 , and worth every bit of the $ 499 price tag imho .####['laptop general']

looks wise it ' s beautiful , i love the minimal design and layout .####['laptop design features']
the keyboard feels nice to use , the keys have a satisfying travel .####['keyboard usability']

it ' s now been totally reliable for half a year or so .####['laptop operation performance']
the build quality on this laptop is awesome for the price .####['laptop price']
the keyboard is clicky , has decent amount of travel , and is backlit .####['keyboard design features']

the screen wasn ' t as clear or bright as i hoped .####['display design features']
it starts up right away and has decent battery life that looks nice .####['battery operation performance', 'os operation performance']

i use this for work , school , and to just watch videos or read books !####['laptop general']
android apps from google play also running well with latest chrome update .####['software operation performance']
everything is very smooth and fast .####['laptop operation performance']

it ' s fast , the display looks like a macbook pro , as does the aluminum case .####['display design features']

when i put it into tablet mode , everything is great .####['laptop operation performance']
however , when i switch back to laptop mode , the keyboard and trackpad are completely disabled and require a reboot to work again .####['hardware operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance']
the volume and backlit - keyboard brightness controls also do not work properly .####['multimedia devices operation performance', 'keyboard operation performance']

i love this laptop because of its size , speed , battery life , and backlit keyboard .####['laptop general', 'laptop design features', 'laptop operation performance', 'keyboard general', 'battery general']
it also has enough power to multi - task .####['laptop design features']
the keyboard makes it easy to type notes quickly and write papers , and the backlit keyboard is a major plus .####['keyboard usability', 'keyboard design features']

i have to say , this is a very nice product .####['laptop general']
well designed , nice fit and finish , and the build quality seems exceptional .####['laptop design features', 'laptop quality']
but now , i ' m totally satisfied with this chromebook !####['laptop general']
