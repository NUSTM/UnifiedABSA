The drinks are just as expensive as the chain coffee houses.####['food', 'place']
I had to chase down our waitress for the food and the bill.####['food', 'staff']
They draw you in with a fancy looking decore which obviously cost a mint, ply you with overpriced wines (one bottle I knew was a 6$and they had the nerve to charge 40) This place sufferes from the same problem Areos does, it rests on its reputation.####['ambience', 'food']
Basically, all the food on the menu is a half-ass'd attempt at vietnamese food, followed by a innappropriate heap of MSG to make up for the lack of any flavor.####['ambience', 'menu']

this place was ok I guess since they have karaoke goin' on with a free shot if you sing.####['place', 'miscellaneous']
