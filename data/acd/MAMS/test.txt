We went again and sat at the bar this time, I had 5 pints of guinness and not one buy-back, I ordered a basket of onion rings and there were about 5 in the basket, the rest was filled with crumbs, the chili was not even edible.####['food', 'place']
The food was good, but it's not worth the wait--or the lousy service.####['service', 'food']
Waiter took our drink order and then we didn't see him for 15 minutes.####['staff', 'miscellaneous']
It does get crowded with plenty of blue shirted cigar smoking wannabes, so make a reservation.####['food', 'miscellaneous']
After hearing all of the specials, you would think they were twice as much as the menu prices (as other places do).####['food', 'price']
Our waitress took our order and then NEVER came back to our table.####['staff', 'miscellaneous']
When we sat down, the waiter barely looked in our direction and abruptly shoved our menus on the table.####['staff', 'menu']
they continue to expand their garden space, w/out expanding their kitchen and cannot provide even adequate service.####['service', 'place']
Extremely RUDE servers who intially took our order and never returned with drinks or to see if we required anythign else.####['food', 'staff']
1) Service is very slow and unattentive (10 minutes for our server to come by with our menus and to take our drink order, another 10 to bring the drinks/take our dinner order, you get the idea.####['service', 'food', 'staff', 'menu']
The Scene This stylish, golden-hued noodle house spiffs up a dull stretch of Sixth Avenue with a crowd ranging from Japanese visitors to NYU students taking advantage of full-flavored, sustaining soups at bargain prices.####['food', 'miscellaneous']
the waiters had a really hard time remembering to bring drinks, and when they did they were not what was ordered.####['food', 'staff']
It is now nothing but an overpriced establishment that is shamelessly riding on the coat tails of its past.####['ambience', 'food']
We arrived at 5:30 and had leave at 7:30 without dessert or coffee because the kitchen took insanely long between courses.####['food', 'place']
It is so difficult to choose a favorite on the menu, because the bolognese, the salmon, the chicken with mushroom, and the telephono are all too good to rank.####['food', 'miscellaneous', 'menu']
Having dined there over a half-dozen I have tried everything on the menu but depending on what night, time and who is taking your order, be prepared for loud, smokey (it is a bar afterall) and herbed waitstaff.####['place', 'staff', 'menu']
I made reservations one week in advance and although I had to change it at the last minute, the hostess was very accommodating and we got seated promptly upstairs overlooking the Buddha.####['staff', 'miscellaneous']
The drinks, served with a little extra in the shaker, anticipate the aptly executed menu, which emphasizes comfort foods of a bygone era--veggies, for example, include crisp Brussels sprouts, shredded beets and bubbling-hot scalloped potatoes.####['food', 'menu']
Needless to say, we weren't suprised when our server told us he never put our appetizer order in.####['food', 'staff']
I ordered chicken vindaloo, the delivery took about an hour, and it cost me $13 with tip.####['food', 'price']
Went with my father without a reservation, and the maitre d' was very nice and sat us within 15 minutes of our arrival - we had been told that the wait would be an hour (this may be unusual).####['service', 'staff', 'miscellaneous']
The cooks in the front are very friendly and helpful.####['staff', 'miscellaneous']
The atmosphere was wonderful, however the service and food were not.####['service', 'ambience', 'food']
no dish on brunch menu over $11 - definitely worth the price.####['price', 'menu']
Id say a little better than most Thai Ive eaten, and the menu had an astounding selection, which isnt bad for such a reasonable price.####['miscellaneous', 'menu', 'price']
However the manager, who refused to come to our table to discuss it, said we were wrong (through the poor waitress) and would not replace our bottle.####['staff', 'miscellaneous']
Don't know about the rest of the food, but the burgers are one of New York's hidden treats.####['service', 'food']
Yes, hard not to look at the waitresses (and they're really good servers), but as I'm reminded by everyone who knows Hooters, they don't rank anywhere near the girls at the Hooters locations South of the ol' Mason-Dixon.####['food', 'staff']
The drinks were really good- albeit a bit weird served out of baby bottles.####['service', 'food', 'miscellaneous']
From a solid homey, affordable Italian menu in a warm, exhileratingly crowded location they've gone to a 30$ minimum per person on opera nights with a quality of food and drink that just does not warrant the prices.####['food', 'menu']
The space is a bit cramped and the waitress seemed to avoid eye contact at all costs, however, I would recommend you go just for the food.####['food', 'place', 'staff']
for instance, i sat next to this couple who experienced problems with their food and the asked to speak to a manager.####['food', 'staff']
The piano guy isn't there all the time, but when he is it's a great addition to the meal.####['ambience', 'food']
The brasserie-style menu remains relatively unchanged, featuring classic bistro choices like frisee salad with bacon, blue cheese and a poached egg, steak tartare, moules and steak frites, and various burgers and sandwiches.####['food', 'miscellaneous', 'menu']
i got a steak special that was way overpriced ($12 more then the steak on the menu and no warning from the waitress) and it was cooked to the wrong temperature.####['food', 'miscellaneous', 'staff', 'menu']
Service was good throughout the dinner but when it came time to get the check, we waited over 20 min.####['service', 'food']
One friend had the steak which he didn't care for, but after waiting so long to be seated he was hungry.####['service', 'food']
The waiter set down my companion's meal and didn't return with my dish for some time.####['food', 'staff']
This set off our critical eye: ceramic bowls having edges higher than the table votives hid the fact that the food was presented cafeteria-style; a rolling-eyed waiter pushing water; the awkward Italian menue gimmick; and the bill.####['food', 'price', 'staff', 'miscellaneous']
I thought it was great, best service I've ever had in a long time.####['service', 'miscellaneous']
After admitting that the items on the bill were not in line with the menu, the manager reserved the right to price at her own discretion!####['price', 'staff', 'menu']
Was greeted and seated with no attitude from the host and hostess, despite no reservation.####['staff', 'miscellaneous']
Ten minutes later the manager relented and dropped off a glass of water with an upturned nose.####['food', 'staff']
Although Nobu requires a 2-3 month advanced reservations, it's worth the wait!####['service', 'miscellaneous']
they waited to get us water after they took our food orders, which took the waitstaff a long time to do.####['food', 'staff']
Be careful with the waiting list- the hostess skipped over our party on the list as we sat waiting for a table, for over an hour.####['staff', 'miscellaneous']
The Food The owners' visits to farmers' markets in Brooklyn drive the ingredient-centric New American menu, which changes about once a month.####['staff', 'menu']
We tried to get the manager who flatly refused to come to our table and discuss the problem with us.####['staff', 'miscellaneous']
After scrunching into the tiny bar area and ordering a drink, I was annoyed but couldn't help but notice the handsome bartender having a tete-a-tete with another French-speaking cutie.####['food', 'staff']
Based on the menu prices, the value of the buffet is made up before you even hit the buffet with the appetizers that are served to the table.####['food', 'miscellaneous']
Fried appetizers, tuna steak and other dishes are also available, as well as an assortment of sakes, graphed on the menu according to flavor components.####['food', 'menu']
The place was empty with three waiters working and it still took 15 minutes to bring us menus.####['place', 'staff', 'menu']
Our waitress kept forgetting our drinks.####['food', 'staff']
the service was horrible then and the food was decent.####['service', 'food']
The place is not meant for in house dining, but if you want to grab a meal on the go, this is the perfect choice.####['food', 'place']
The bar area was fairly crowded but service remained friendly and efficient.####['service', 'place']
Our last experience: Waiting for a table at the bar (we always make reservations), the bartender ignored us until my husband intervened with one of the owners.####['staff', 'miscellaneous']
Waitress was nice but didnt know some specials and was alittle off, think she was new.####['food', 'staff']
Yes it's pricey for counter service, sawdust floors and deafening chatter but the pastrami makes it all worth it.####['service', 'food']
For the prices, the food is decidedly lackluster, and the service, unless you are a regular, can be quite rude.####['service', 'food', 'price']
the waitress never asked us how the food was or if we needed anything.####['food', 'staff']
My complaint was with the service-- our waitress was rather pushy and visibly annoyed when we didn't order appetizers or dessert.####['food', 'staff']
The bartender virtually ignored us while we waited, took 15 minutes to get drinks.####['food', 'staff']
The only saving grace is the sweet tea - but even that isn't worth the wait.####['service', 'food']
Then the waitress became upset when she returned with the drinks and we didn't stop our conversations quick enough to remind her who had ordered what only 5 minutes prior.####['food', 'staff']
Oh, and kudos to the hostess who appeared out of thin air with extra napkins just moments after a glass of water was knocked over - she's upping the bar on service here.####['place', 'staff', 'service', 'food', 'ambience']
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.####['food', 'miscellaneous', 'menu']
I especially recommend ordering the duck, foie gras, and beef cheeks although it's probably hard to go wrong with anything on the menu.####['food', 'menu']
The noise here is so bad that people entered and left without ordering and they lowered the lights during the dinner.####['ambience', 'food']
Sure, the burgers are good, but not good enough to make up for the abominable service and disgusting, filthy atmosphere.####['food', 'ambience']
The waiter appeared promptly, took our order, bought us drinks and was never to be seen again.####['food', 'staff']
Our waitress had no clue about the menu and (after we had ordered a bottle of wine) told us the kitchen was closing and stood guard until we ordered.####['food', 'place', 'menu']
The brunch entrees were shockingly overpriced, even for the area, and especially given the food quality.####['food', 'place']
Upon walking in and noticing the exposed red brick wall and the white tableclothes and and huge rack of various wines behind the bar, I felt like I was in a truly authentic Italian restaurant.####['food', 'miscellaneous']
Staff wouldn't take no for an answer on pitchers of sangria.####['food', 'staff']
I went here all 4 years that I lived in the area, and being a not-so-loaded student, it was a great place to go for some good sushi and a very pleasant comforting atmosphere.####['food', 'place', 'ambience']
From the outside this place looks cute, however, once inside loud as a disco!####['place', 'miscellaneous']
The portions were very big for appetizers (calimari and fried zucchini) but average for the entrees (chicken marsala, spaghetti w/ meatballs) and very expensive of course.####['food', 'miscellaneous']
service was attentive at the beginning but the waiter lost us towards the end and we had to flag them down for the check.####['service', 'staff']
Then the waiter came back for our food order at 10, and we hadn't received our drinks yet.####['food', 'staff']
Other than making the grill flame at the beginning our hibatchi chef didnt put on much of a show - no flipping stuff into is hat or our plates - so if that is your thing go to Benihani.####['staff', 'miscellaneous']
Check out the little room with the red seats and candles and get a green dragon saketini - it's worth the NYC cocktail price ($14).####['food', 'price', 'miscellaneous']

When the spastic waiter finally stopped by our table, we told him we were going to order everything at once b/c we were getting pretty hungry.####['staff', 'miscellaneous']
My mother and I had our chairs bumped over a dozen times by hasty waiters.####['staff', 'miscellaneous']
After all that, it is average food at best with huge bill at the end.####['food', 'price']
However, when our waitress realized her faux pas, an extra glass of wine was sent to our table and all was forgiven.####['food', 'staff', 'miscellaneous']
when I came back for brunch a week or so later, I was told that the marscapone version was no longer being served, because there was a new cook.####['service', 'food', 'staff']
The Food Though much of the menu draws from border countries with the likes of pasta, cordon bleu and schnitzel, dishes that involve cheese are best.####['food', 'menu']
D, who can't decide on a single dish, the tapas menu allowed me to express my true culinary self.####['food', 'menu']
We weren't even offered a dinner menu and the waitress didn't even notice that we wanted drinks until after I ordered them from the bar myself.####['food', 'staff', 'menu']
The food was good overall, but unremarkable given the price.####['food', 'price']
overall the food we ordered (pancit luglug, chicken adobo, romy's ribs, lumpia shanghai, a bowl of green soup that resembles the polyjuice potion harry potter drank) was not screaming with taste.####['food', 'miscellaneous']
On the top of everything at the end of the dinner the waiter gave us the wrong check.####['food', 'price', 'staff']
The Food There's a Mediterranean bent to the menu--hummus, babaganoush and stuffed grape leaves are offered, as well as Moroccan chicken and spicy Merguez lamb sausage.####['food', 'menu']
Our food took so long to be served that we nearly missed our curtain.####['service', 'food', 'miscellaneous']
They brought fresh naan to the table as well as a kind of crepe filled with potatoes that was cooked on a griddle set up by the window.####['food', 'miscellaneous']

Try the Bocadillos to start and don't forget to order a Mojito from the bar (they're the best!####['food', 'place']
The waitress came back with the bill and money (with a calculator) and asked for more tips.####['price', 'staff']
Odd, traditional and clashing decor will only detract from your experience if the square box layout or perma-draft through the pane glass door doesn't get you first.####['ambience', 'miscellaneous']
If it's just a quick martini at the bar (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken, go to Village!####['food', 'place']
For dessert the waiter reccomended his favorite which was a Torreja.####['food', 'staff']
Thanks to waiter I learned so much about wine too.####['food', 'staff']
Each week, Zutto's sushi chef never ceases to amaze me with new concoctions.####['food', 'staff']

We were given only one waiter for 20 people, and it honestly took over 1/2 an hour to get coffee (I actully went across the street to Dunkin Donuts!)####['food', 'staff']
From the space shuttle trip entrance to mars, to the molecular regenerator exit to earth, it was all an exquisite dining experience.####['place', 'miscellaneous']
Service was fine and the food delivered in reasonable time given the crowd, but for the price I was disappointed.####['service', 'food', 'price', 'miscellaneous']
No bread basket for the table, the server came around with a basket and we each got 1 piece of bread.####['staff', 'miscellaneous']
The baked penne came out in a small bowl, burnt with barley any sauce for $18.####['food', 'miscellaneous']
Waited for a table, got disgusting martinis at the bar, and sat down.####['food', 'place', 'miscellaneous']
If you order the platters all of your typical Indian side items are included so it is a good value.####['food', 'miscellaneous']
(And the mixed steamed seafood appetizer took *forever* to arrive -- apparently the oysters here are shucked by machine, and they only have one shucker, so if more than one table orders anything off of that section of the menu, you'll be waiting a while.####['food', 'menu']
AND you can still smoke at the outermost area of the patio - the wait staff can't technically serve you there because of the smoking, but if you don't mind walking to the bar to place an order (I don't), it's a great solution for smokers.####['place', 'miscellaneous']
I came to celebrate finishing my third year of med school and was greatly disappointed by the way I was treated at the door (rude and terse), the food (mediocre), and the ambiance (very loud, crowded, and uncomfortable close to our neighbors despite the large room).####['food', 'ambience', 'place']

Between the 6 of us we tried almost everything on the menu and we were all very pleased with our meals.####['food', 'menu']
the decor could be a bit better, and if there was a small bar the overall atmosphere would be a bit more inviting (especially for regulars).####['ambience', 'place']
The service is smart and though they can be overwhelmed with the crowds, does a good job.####['service', 'miscellaneous']
for the prices that are on the regular menu we were expecting something more upscale and less generic.####['price', 'menu']
Even if you're just a middling junior exec, staff service makes you feel like a board member.####['service', 'miscellaneous']
The waitress was slow and had to ask the kitchen first every time we asked her about anything on the menu.####['staff', 'menu']
The waitor never gave us the specials menu (which they gave to a another couple who sat next to us 20 minutes later) and the service was very slow even for the basics (bread and water, for which we had to ask a couple of times).####['service', 'food']
Tried to get a table during restaurant week but there was an over an hour wait.####['service', 'miscellaneous']
71 Irving's coffee is not only delicious but also consistently delicious.####['food', 'miscellaneous']
In Short The few window-front tables fill quickly, but most customers prefer not to linger in the nondescript space, in favor of taking their Thai food to go, or phoning in for delivery.####['place', 'miscellaneous']
Although the restaurant was far from crowded (maybe three tables), service was abysmally slow, to the point that we wondered if the server was trying to avoid us.####['service', 'place', 'staff']
They seem under staffed and Waiters do not really know the menu.####['staff', 'menu']
i also like their cocktail menu and dessert menu (try the black tea rose ice cream and the coconout waffles).####['food', 'menu']
I love it at lunch time, less expensive, excellent food, awesome people-watching (Hi, Regis who is right next to our table) and really nice and airy in the summertime when they open the windows.####['food', 'miscellaneous']

she never once checked on us after serving our drinks, we asked another waitress about our sandwiches, she attempted to check on them but didn't really get an answer.####['food', 'staff']
But the wait staff's attitude will make me rethink about returning.####['service', 'staff']

from the hostess to the bartender to the waiter (who told us that we had to leave because the tables needed to be turned around more quickly even though it was a friends engagement dinner).####['food', 'place', 'staff']
Our waiter did not come back once to reserve our wine.####['food', 'staff']
45 minutes later our less-than-stellar pizza and their even less-than-stellar gnoccho was dropped at the table; no explanation or apology or attempt to acknowledge the ridiculous wait.####['service', 'food', 'miscellaneous']
We told the waitress we'd like the fries hot with our main courses but she only ordered more once the rest of the food had arrived so we didn't get them until we were half way through.####['food', 'staff']
We received our food and coffee at the same time, and couldn't get the attention of any waiter to refill our cups.####['food', 'staff']
The service was spotty as a couple of drink orders were forgotten and the waiter didn't really come to check on us.####['service', 'food', 'staff']
Costs could be better - expect to be upsold by the hovering wait staff - and come for the authentic tastes, not the interior decor (looked a littel like Cheers!####['ambience', 'staff']
Once the food came, we could not eat because we did not have the little plates for the soy sauce.####['food', 'miscellaneous']
The menu is short and sweet: hamburgers, cheeseburgers and double cheeseburgers, with all-beef patties steam-grilled on a pile of onions and served on square white buns with pickles.####['food', 'menu']
I had the first pasta listed on the menu and it left me craving the taste again for days after.####['food', 'menu']
To elaborate; the menu is written in French but the dishes themselves are something that your - enthusiastic yet talentless boyfriend - might muster up for you, leaving you looking concerned for his love for you.####['food', 'menu']

Instead, Yasuda's swarm of waiters and waitresses hovered incessantly overhead, seizing any opportunity to fill a glass, reorganize the table, ask if we were done, and of course clear us out of there in under 80 min.####['staff', 'miscellaneous']
However, they do bring you a lot of food for your buck, and despite the unremarkable food it strikes me as a good place to fill up on the cheap for lunch or after a night of drinking.####['food', 'place']
Waited an hour for the food to come out, couldnt even find the waitress.####['food', 'staff']
The Food The French-Belgian menu is small, and everything on it is satisfyingly savory, such as a simple pot of mussels in a choice of sauces (beer and bacon, creamy mushroom, or white wine-and-garlic broth); beef stewed with beer and prunes; and a juicy croque monsieur.####['food', 'miscellaneous']
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.####['food', 'menu']

Self-important people, please stay at home and cook and dump as much parmesan on as you like.####['food', 'miscellaneous']

There are decent selections if you are a seafood person, but not a lot if you aren't!####['food', 'miscellaneous']
With 5 items on the menu and prices this low, you'd think turnover would be a priority -- think again!!!####['price', 'menu']

I was at Son Cubano a few months ago, and although i was only at the bar (without prior reservations which are a must), i had an awesome time.####['place', 'miscellaneous']
It took us about 30 minutes to get seated, the burgers came without lettuce, they brougt us the wrong drinks, and the flavor of the burgers were below average.####['service', 'food', 'ambience']
However when the party was complete we had the other waitress come over who said that we had to order all the food at once and couldnt order just appetizers.####['food', 'staff']
Server was nonexistent; when we flagged her down, she told us that the food was 'being plated' when clearly they were just starting to prepare it.####['food', 'staff']
We were so irritated about how horrible the food was, we didn't stick around to hangout at the bar.####['food', 'place']
Those appetizers only appeared after we complained to the manager.####['food', 'staff']
When one compares the quality of the food to some of the city's other italian restaurants, and then particularly when one factors in the very reasonable prices here, I feel that this restaurant comes out a winner.####['food', 'price']
I did not like the place because: -it took the waiter over 20 min to take our order and then over an hour until we got our food.####['food', 'staff']
I was lured in by the fact that they have soy options for almost everything that includes dairy on the menu, as well as tofu subs for eggs; It is hard to find mexican tinged food with an optional vegetarian slant.####['food', 'menu']
And the owner didnt seem to care, she was more interested in talking at the bar than hearing from me.####['place', 'staff']
On Friday night the busboy was sulky verging on rude; he brought the fries (ordered for the entrees) twice before the appetizers came and then again the minute we'd finished them and looked put out to be asked to take the empty plates away.####['food', 'staff']
I don't even think I would have minded waiting at the bar for over an hour if it weren't so crowded and if they had little tapas for the hungry people forced to wait!####['food', 'place']

The service was terrible- our waiter was unable to make any recommendations, mumbled the special and failed to check back during the course of our meal.####['service', 'food', 'staff']
The decor has not quite made the transition--some really nice artifacts are still there, but there are several layers of different remodeling efforts visible.####['ambience', 'miscellaneous']
