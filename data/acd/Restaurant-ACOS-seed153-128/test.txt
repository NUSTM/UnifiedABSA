good food !####['food quality']
this is a great place to get a delicious meal .####['restaurant general', 'food quality']
the staff is pretty friendly .####['service general']
the onion rings are great !####['food quality']
the lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns , the few they actually give you . . . . . were not good .####['food style options', 'food quality']
nice ambience , but highly overrated place .####['restaurant general', 'ambience general']
worst service i ever had####['service general']
everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received .####['service general']
our waiter was non - existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered , we were not given any water or utensils .####['service general']
i complained to the manager , but he was not even apologetic .####['service general']

i have not a bad thing to say about this place .####['restaurant general']
the food was great !####['food quality']
it ' s * very * reasonably priced , esp for the quality of the food .####['food prices', 'food quality']
i had the kafta plate and it was perfect .####['food quality']
– in a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants , its nice to see a place that bucks that trend , and just plain delivers high quality food and good service , period .####['service general', 'food quality']
this is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer .####['ambience general', 'food quality']
caution - its real food for people who love the best .####['food quality']
i liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price .####['food prices', 'ambience general', 'food quality']
i may not be a sushi guru but i can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it .####['food quality']
rice is too dry , tuna was n ' t so fresh either .####['food quality']
i have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent .####['food style options', 'food quality']
however , the value and service are both severely lacking .####['restaurant prices', 'service general']
furthermore , while the fish is unquestionably fresh , rolls tend to be inexplicably bland .####['food quality']
the service ranges from mediocre to offensive .####['service general']
on a recent trip , our waiter was extremely dismissive , while no less than three staff members waited hand - and - foot on a pair of japanese girls seated nearby .####['service general']
freshest sushi – i love this restaurant .####['restaurant general', 'food quality']
they pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls .####['food quality']
the sashimi was the freshest and most tender i have ever tasted .####['food quality']
their apps are all delicious .####['food quality']
the only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side .####['food style options', 'restaurant prices']
but the space is small and lovely , and the service is helpful .####['service general', 'ambience general']
– the food was not great & the waiters were rude .####['service general', 'food quality']
great service####['service general']
my service was stellar !####['service general']
the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me .####['service general']
food was fine , with a some little - tastier - than - normal salsa .####['food quality']
the food was great , the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me .####['service general', 'food quality']
mama mia – i live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place .####['restaurant general']
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it ' s edible , even when you order ahead .####['food quality']
but once done , it ' s not too much dough , not too much cheese , not too much sauce .####['food quality']
best sushi in town .####['food quality']
the best calamari in seattle !####['food quality']

they have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from ; atlantic or pacific .####['food style options']
i ' ve had the jellyfish , horse mackerel , blue fin tuna and the sake ikura roll among others , and they were all good .####['food quality']
my only negative comment is that i wish the pieces were a little bigger .####['food style options']
the decor is rustic , traditional japanese .####['ambience general']
the crowd is mixed yuppies , young and old .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
the service was courteous and attentive .####['service general']
mediocre food####['food quality']
the outside patio area has an abbreviated menu .####['food style options']
my g / f and i both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price .####['food prices', 'food quality']
we are locals , and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one - time customer tourists .####['restaurant general', 'food quality']
service was decent .####['service general']
drinks were good .####['drinks quality']
excellent food , nice ambience , fairly expensive####['restaurant prices', 'ambience general', 'food quality']
– i loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi ( 5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis ) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes .####['food style options', 'food quality']
the ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in downtown disney .####['ambience general']
best indian food in l . a .####['food quality']
the chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes .####['food quality']
the chana masala ( garbanzo beans ) are also excellent .####['food quality']

never too crowded and always great service .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'service general']
i think i have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent .####['food quality']
i can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma .####['food quality']
i appreciate their delivery too .####['service general']
nice food but no spice !####['food quality']
– i really enjoyed my meal here .####['food quality']
i had yummy lamb korma , saag paneer , samosas , naan , etc .####['food quality']
the food was all good but it was way too mild .####['food quality']
the naan was some of the best i ' ve had and i really enjoyed the bhartha , not too tomatoey .####['food quality']
even the chickpeas , which i normally find too dry , were good .####['food quality']
– i do n ' t understand how i was a stranger to this place for so long . . . the fajita salad , the colorado , the fajitas - everything is delicious .####['food quality']
i love the warm & cosy environment .####['ambience general']
i just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party - ca n ' t wait to celebrate my next birthday there .####['restaurant miscellaneous']

holy hummus !####['food quality']
– the food is here is incredible , though the quality is inconsistent during lunch .####['food quality']
dinners have always been excellent , in terms of food quality .####['food quality']
the open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given .####['food style options', 'food prices']
the side of potatoes is to die for , as is the labne ( yogurt dip ) .####['food quality']
also , they serve the best hummus in america , with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil ( which , i believe is the traditional way ) !####['food style options', 'food quality']
the only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'service general']
however , this place is a gem , and i wo n ' t stop going back .####['restaurant general']
great beer####['drinks quality']
– my first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible !####['restaurant general']
i swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal .####['drinks quality', 'food quality']
the band was very good and the service was attentive .####['service general', 'ambience general']
we ordered a selection of the small plates , and the shoe string onions , goat cheese pizza , grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good .####['food quality']
seattle ' s best winelist####['drinks style options']
– ray ' s ( suprisingly ) has the city ' s best & most diverse wine list .####['drinks style options']
the sommelier is fantastic , down - to - earth , & extremely knowlegable .####['service general']
i would go back for the wine experience alone .####['drinks quality']
not the place it once was####['restaurant general']
perhaps now , scooner or later falls into the ` ` dive ' ' category .####['restaurant general']
– it is sad to see a place that was once ` ` the ' ' place to meet and eat for bfast or lunch , now be the place that is a big ` ` dont bother . ' '####['restaurant general']
the food is not what it once was ( potions have seriously seen downsizing ) prices have gone up , and the service is the worst i have experienced anywhere ( including mainland europe ) .####['service general', 'food prices', 'food quality']
what may be interesting to most is the worst sevice / attitude comes from the owners of this establishment .####['service general']
this establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of food televisions ` ` diners , drive - ins , and dives ' ' hosted by guy fieri , in which schooner or later was subject of .####['restaurant general']

great meal – the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent - - there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi - - this fish was perfect ! ! ! !####['food quality']

the sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick .####['service general', 'food quality']
the atmosphere was just okay .####['ambience general']
space was limited , but the food made up for it .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'food quality']
we stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us .####['service general']
finally , my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked , ` ` are you waiting for a table ? ' '####['service general']
the caesar salad i ordered had so much lemon i could n ' t eat it .####['food quality']
great food , better margaritas !####['drinks quality', 'food quality']

not only can the selection be innovative , but there ' s a nice balance of traditional sushi as well .####['food style options']
the nicest waiters in town .####['service general']
– this place is unbelievably over - rated .####['restaurant general']
if i want to stand in line on sunday for an hour to get average brunch food , then i would put murphy ' s at the top of the list .####['service general', 'food quality']
the regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive .####['service general', 'food quality']
your a sushi fan , you love expertly cut fish , great sake , a killer soho location , and of course : salmon , tuna , fluke , yellow tail , cod , mackeral , jellyfish , sea urchin , shrimp , lobster , sea bream , trout , milk fish , blue fin tuna , eel , crab , sardine , monk fish , roe , scallop , oysters , and a varity of toro .####['food style options', 'location general', 'drinks quality', 'food quality']

bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world : blue ribbon sushi .####['restaurant general']
hands down , the best tuna i have ever had .####['food quality']
blue ribbon lives up to it ' s fantastic reputation .####['restaurant general']
great value sushi with high quality & nice setting .####['ambience general', 'food prices', 'food quality']
try the chef ' s choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty .####['food quality']
poor customer service / poor pizza .####['service general', 'food quality']
– as with most restaurants in seattle , mioposto ' s service was bad and the food was overpriced .####['service general', 'food prices']
i know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places , but mioposto ' s pizza lacks quality and good taste .####['food quality']
to be honest , i ' ve had better frozen pizza .####['food quality']
the only positive thing about mioposto is the nice location .####['restaurant general', 'location general']
i was frankly shocked when i read the bad reviews - this place is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way , and we ' ve eaten here more than 10 times .####['restaurant general']
the food is fantastic , and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we ' ve been there .####['service general', 'food quality']
the only problem would be the wait , but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting .####['service general']
seabass on lobster risotto was the best .####['food quality']
caesar salad was superb .####['food quality']
great bottle of wine .####['drinks quality']
leave room for dessert .####['food quality']
i waited for 10 - 15 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again .####['service general']
the food was ok , but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served .####['service general', 'food quality']
avoid the place####['restaurant general']
when i got there i sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible !####['service general', 'ambience general']
we left without ever getting service .####['service general']
best crab cakes in town####['food quality']
– thats a big statement considering i ' ve been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since i was about seven - but something about these little devils gets better every time .####['food quality']
if you can , come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
great seasonal fish and seafood , with a classy waterfront setting .####['ambience general', 'food quality']
great pizza , poor service####['service general', 'food quality']
– love their pizza , especially the mushroom pizza .####['food quality']
also love their caeser salad .####['food quality']
prefer to order it and pick it up though because i do n ' t like the servers , one young woman in particular .####['service general']
– this place is famous for their breakfast .####['food quality']
many people talk about the great pizza and poor service , so it ca n ' t just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers .####['service general', 'food quality']
it ' s a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n ' t so impersonal and corporate - like .####['restaurant general', 'service general']
great breakfast####['food quality']
the food is great and they make a mean bloody mary .####['drinks quality', 'food quality']
i love breakfast here .####['food quality']
their crab eggs benedict is addicting .####['food quality']
all their menu items are a hit , and they serve mimosas .####['drinks style options', 'food quality']
best chinese food i have tasted in a long time####['food quality']
the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning .####['ambience general']
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese .####['service general']
so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter . . . soooo good . . . the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty .####['food quality']
best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted .####['food quality']
the brocollis were so fresh and tasty .####['food quality']
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time , every piece was as eventful as the first one . . . the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked .####['food quality']
chintzy portions####['food style options']
– the sushi here is perfectly good , but for $ 5 a piece , either the slices of fish should be larger , or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant ( even for nyc ) .####['food style options', 'restaurant prices', 'food prices', 'food quality']
terrible service , food ok , pricey####['restaurant prices', 'service general', 'food quality']
food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n ' t a fancy place .####['ambience general', 'food prices', 'food quality']
if i needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or golden gate park .####['location general']
another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides .####['ambience general']
amazing spanish mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi ( that eel with avodcao - - um um um ) .####['food quality']
as usual the omikase did n ' t disappoint in freshness , although it scored low on creativity and selection .####['food style options', 'food quality']
their specialty rolls are impressive , though i ca n ' t remember what we had .####['food quality']
green tea creme brulee gets better each time i have it .####['food quality']
great selection of sakes .####['drinks style options']
it is n ' t the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time .####['food prices', 'food quality']
very poor customer service .####['service general']
– schooner or later ' s charming location along the marina in long beach and average food does not , unfortunately , compensate for its very poor customer service .####['location general', 'service general', 'food quality']
while this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service .####['service general', 'food quality']
the fish was fresh , though it was cut very thin .####['food quality']
great service .####['service general']
good sake selection .####['drinks style options']
dungeness crabs here !####['food quality']
– ray ' s is the place to go for high quality seafood dinners .####['food quality']
i love dungeness crabs and at ray ' s you can get them served in about 6 different ways !####['food style options']
we shared the family platter and i especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu .####['food quality']
i ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting . . . . yummy !####['food quality']
and the service was simply spendid - quite a delight .####['service general']
– great drinks , corn beef hash , coffee , b fast burritos , gluten free menu .####['food style options', 'drinks quality', 'food quality']
the service is fantastic at this fun place .####['restaurant general', 'service general']
if there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a place is open , you know it is great .####['restaurant general']
best neighborhood standby .####['restaurant general']
in grammercy / union square / east village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot .####['restaurant general']
the music is great , no night better or worse , the bar tenders are generous with the pouring , and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits .####['drinks style options', 'ambience general']
oh , and the cheese fries are awesome !####['food quality']
good food , great service , average prices ( for the strip )####['restaurant prices', 'service general', 'food quality']
when i walked in , i was taken aback by their incredible wood decor .####['ambience general']
the music playing was very hip , 20 - 30 something pop music , but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat , which became annoying midway through dinner .####['ambience general']
i got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright .####['food quality']
it was n ' t the freshest seafood ever , but the taste and presentation was ok .####['food style options', 'food quality']
i picked the asparagus , which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared .####['food quality']
the 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great , at least initially .####['food quality']
the steak was done to my exact liking ( medium rare ) and was nice and juicy .####['food quality']
it ? s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste .####['food quality']
though , one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak .####['food quality']
the desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner .####['food quality']
overall , i would go back and eat at the restaurant again .####['restaurant general']
but the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly .####['service general']
good sake , good food – i honestly do n ' t know much about japanese food at all .####['drinks quality', 'food quality']
server made several sake suggestions which were very good .####['drinks quality', 'service general']
had many dishes but the best was the lobster 3 ways .####['food quality']
the waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded .####['service general', 'ambience general']
also , there was only one bathroom stall - probably need more for such big crowds .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
most importantly , we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu .####['food style options']
at best , the food was good and definately overpriced .####['food quality']
for the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower .####['food style options', 'food prices']

i have been to this place , folks and it is bad .####['restaurant general']
maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that ' s half - way decent .####['food quality']
i have been here , spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment .####['food prices', 'food quality']
– the atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate .####['ambience general']
the best dish are the honwy walnut prawns - just outstanding .####['food quality']
fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $ 100 dollar plate and not one was eatable .####['food style options', 'food prices', 'food quality']

it ' s a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend ( thurs ? sun ) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
everything , and i mean everything on the menu is delectable .####['food quality']
the waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .####['service general']
the sushi is as fresh as it comes ? you ' d think ocean was in their backyard , no joke !####['food quality']
if you ' re interested in good tasting ( without the fish taste or smell ) , large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place . . .####['food style options', 'food quality']

fair menu selection .####['food style options']
the appetizer was interesting , but the creme brulee was very savory and delicious .####['food quality']
indoor ambience was modern .####['ambience general']
if it ' s nice outside , request for a table in the balcony .####['ambience general']
it ' s a great place to people watch .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
late night dinning with exeptional food .####['food quality']
we were seated right away , the table was private and nice .####['service general', 'ambience general']
the service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters .####['service general']
the food was very good , filet mignon was probably the best i ' ve ever try .####['food quality']
the portions are big though , so do not order too much .####['food style options']
groovy music made the dinner casual .####['ambience general']
i have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
– mercedes restaurant is so tasty , the service is undeniably awesome !####['service general', 'food quality']
the catering is out of this world , and raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world ! ! !####['food quality']
drinks are suberb , and i feel like i am in a third world country when i walk in the door .####['drinks quality', 'ambience general']
the presentation of snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu .####['food style options', 'restaurant prices', 'ambience general']
to start off , approximately 8 - 10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 .####['drinks prices']
they serve it in a tall , skinny hour - glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .####['drinks style options', 'drinks prices']
i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their menu was so unique that i continued .####['food style options']
the pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8 . 50 for 3 - 6 ' ' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 ' ' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over - priced .####['food style options', 'food prices']
the pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 ' ' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .####['food style options', 'food prices']
on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if i had n ' t rejected the meal all together .####['food quality']
i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue .####['food quality']
in the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( i had water ) .####['food style options', 'food prices', 'drinks prices']
much more than just a great view !####['restaurant general', 'location general']
– i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray ' s boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations .####['restaurant general']
ray ' s is something of a seattle institution , but given its gorgeous sound views , i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .####['location general']
imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third - best thing about ray ' s !####['restaurant general', 'location general']
to start things off , our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .####['service general']
my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the shilshole sampler . . . a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , ray ' s fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .####['food style options', 'food quality']
for my entr & eacute ; e , i completely enjoyed the seared alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano .####['food style options', 'food quality']
the scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique ( not to mention tasty ) .####['food style options', 'food quality']
my friend enjoyed the grilled alaskan king salmon with delectable creamed washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .####['food quality']
i had a taste of all three items on her plate , and they were superb .####['food quality']
our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but i did remain puzzled by one issue : who thinks that ray ' s is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'service general']
while i could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'service general', 'food quality']
oh yeah . . . the view was good , too .####['location general']
yum !####['food quality']
do n ' t leave the restaurant without it .####['food quality']
no comparison####['restaurant general']
– i ca n ' t say enough about this place .####['restaurant general']
snotty attitude####['service general']
– we were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast .####['service general']
we never had to wait more than 5 minutes .####['service general']
they are not greasy or anything .####['food quality']
overrated####['restaurant general']
– i was highly disappointed in the food at pagoda .####['food quality']
i will not go back .####['restaurant general']
i will never return again .####['restaurant general']
it was absolutely amazing .####['restaurant general']
amazing .####['restaurant general']
i can not wait to go back again this coming weekend !####['restaurant general']
mmm . . . good !####['restaurant general']
we ' re going back . : d####['restaurant general']
finally a meal that you will remember for a long time !####['food quality']
very disappointing####['restaurant general']
– i took my parents here for their anniversary - very very disappointed ! ! !####['restaurant general']
nothing really came across as outstanding .####['food quality']
very disappointed .####['restaurant general']
we were then charged for their most expensive sake ( $ 20 + per serving ) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price .####['service general']
you are bound to have a very charming time .####['restaurant general']
not recommanded ! ! !####['restaurant general']
it is not worth going at all and spend your money there ! ! !####['restaurant general']
– pretty cheap for sit down mexican and downtown .####['location general', 'restaurant prices']
if you ' re in the area you should n ' t be disappointed .####['restaurant general']
ok . . . . – maybe i went in on someone ' s bad day . . . .####['restaurant general']
took forever to get our order taken , water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention .####['service general']
i do n ' t know if i ' ll be back . . . .####['restaurant general']
everything you want and more , very fresh .####['food style options', 'food quality']
its worth the wait , especially since they ' ll give you a call when the table is ready .####['restaurant general', 'service general']
i went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast !####['restaurant general']
every time ` ` 0 - sixtynine ' ' is called the bartender buys everyone drinks !####['service general']
been there lots since and its always a good time .####['restaurant general']
i found a new home on second avenue ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !####['restaurant general']
just go there and see for yourself .####['restaurant general']
you need to watch your game , they will have it on for you .####['service general']
kudos to these guys .####['restaurant general']
i found a new home and just moved with a long lease .####['restaurant general']
unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks i would n ' t recommend going here .####['restaurant general', 'drinks quality']
you are likely to be disappointed .####['restaurant general']
it was romantic - and even nice even with my sister , reminded me of italy , and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a mediterrean villa .####['ambience general']
i recommend it for a night when you want to splurge ! ( it was a bit expensive )####['restaurant general', 'restaurant prices']
the best thing is , the prices are also quite reasonable .####['restaurant prices']
hidden little jem####['restaurant general']
– tucked away over by the beverly center .####['location general']
you routinely see indian families and friends dining there , which is always a good sign .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
normally , places ask how hot you want it , but they did n ' t .####['service general']
i should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild .####['food quality']
and they packaged everything nicely so it did n ' t spill .####['service general']
awesome find####['restaurant general']
you can order to go if you have to get back to the office too !####['service general']
lebanese food ! yum !####['food quality']
– i ' ve been to open sesame only once , but i ' m still reeling from the experience ! !####['restaurant general']
what a tastly , flaky treat !####['food quality']
there have been several occasions when we ' ve just not gotten some side dishes we ' ve ordered .####['service general']
we waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1 / 2 hours for our food .####['service general']
however , one sunday afternoon my husband and i did go ( although with my loud protests ) and were pleasantly surprised .####['restaurant general']
it was like dining at a completely different restaurant .####['restaurant general']
we have since returned and also had a great experience , sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good ) .####['restaurant general', 'drinks quality']
we did have the same waiter the second time , so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good .####['service general']
sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun .####['ambience general']
nice job !####['restaurant general']
this is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat .####['restaurant general']
i hope one day scooner or later returns to what it once was .####['restaurant general']
untill this happens , my advice is to stay away .####['restaurant general']
old reliable####['restaurant general']
– after 12 years in seattle ray ' s rates as the place we always go back to .####['restaurant general']
i liked it .####['restaurant general']
it was so much though that i could barely finish but i did , since it was delicious .####['food style options', 'food quality']
wow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !####['restaurant general']
– it cant get any better ! ! ! ! !####['restaurant general']
absolutely fabulous ! ! !####['restaurant general']
two thumbs up !####['food quality']
this is right up there with places in tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned .####['food quality']
splendid####['restaurant general']
perfect on a cold day .####['food quality']
$ 6 with tip .####['restaurant prices']
perfection .####['restaurant general']
on weekends , you might have to wait for couple hours .####['service general']
however , they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone .####['service general']
that ' s a huge compliment , especially in the fickled restaurant business , . . . enough already !####['restaurant general']
i guarantee you wo n ' t be disappointed , there ' s also valet parking .####['restaurant general', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
a cozy spot for 2####['ambience general']
– i ca n ' t believe murphy ' s has been around for over 25 years , amazing .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
addicting !####['restaurant general']
i went there with a friend from out of town . . . and we were both very impressed !####['restaurant general']
the price was right too .####['restaurant prices']
i ' d go back there in a heartbeat .####['restaurant general']
well i guess it ' s hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff .####['service general']
once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal .####['service general']
the prior reviews said kid friendly . . . give me a break with two young children that is light years .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
it was decent but nothing exceptional .####['food quality']
the place is the next best thing to my moms cooking .####['food quality']
way over - rated ! ! ! !####['restaurant general']
10 !####['restaurant general']
cut to the chase - this is amazing !####['restaurant general']
it ' s unpretentious and underground .####['ambience general']
it ' s fresh , welcoming , delicious , and relaxing .####['ambience general', 'food quality']
i went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again .####['restaurant general']
what a find !####['restaurant general']
well worth it####['restaurant general']
good for late night dining ( last minute planning ) without reservations .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
love it every time####['restaurant general']
never had one single problem there .####['restaurant general']
seafood plus####['food quality']
– this was great dining experience .####['restaurant general']
if you ' re going to see danny gans or just staying at the mirage , do n ' t miss this one .####['restaurant general']
completely over rated !####['restaurant general']
even then , the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items .####['service general']
we had a very hard time getting the waitress ' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .####['service general']
as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 % discount on our bill .####['service general']
when the bill came , he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks .####['service general']
it was clear he didn ’ t really care .####['service general']
– save yourself the waste of time & do not visit .####['restaurant general']
after sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes i left .####['service general']
i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n ' t work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
i never heard back from anyone more than a month ago .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
after sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she ' d be right with us .####['service general']
as of writing this i just tried their give away a link again & it still does n ' t work .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
always a winner .####['restaurant general']
she does n ' t make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance .####['service general']
but she is very friendly with certain people , making it even more annoying .####['service general']
management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners .####['service general']
they have been featured on the food network and they deserve it .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
does n ' t get any better than that .####['restaurant general']
you can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing .####['ambience general']
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up .####['ambience general']
first off , the food came fast and all together : ) i like that . . . i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other .####['service general']
yummy .####['food quality']
not chewy at all .####['food quality']
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee . . . oh la la yummy ! ! !####['food quality']
melt in your mouth .####['food quality']
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant .####['restaurant general']
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel . . . but they are definitely one you dont want to miss , esp if your in downtown san jose .####['restaurant general']
we easily spent more than $ 40 per person ( not including alcohol ) and were still hungry .####['food style options', 'restaurant prices']
i ' m astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ .####['restaurant prices']
we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it ' d be a 30 minute wait .####['service general']
we went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago ! !####['service general']
none that i can think of .####['restaurant general']
we put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n ' t arrive until 45 minutes later . . . with our main course .####['service general']
um so now what are appetizers for ? ? ?####['service general']
oh i forgot to mention that they do n ' t have bread service .####['service general']
my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water ( she had a sore throat ) and i guess that since it was only water , it was n ' t a priority for them to actually bring it .####['service general']
in other words , if they are n ' t making $ $ off of you then you do n ' t rate high on their ' service scale ' .####['service general']
its great if you spent the day there and did n ' t want to drive to eat .####['location general']
parking is reasonably good , they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
always good .####['restaurant general']
6pm on a sat before a broadway play and we were quickly seated and served .####['service general']
as part of a small party of four , our food was dropped off without comment ;####['service general']
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table .####['service general']
when we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order .####['service general']
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment - - to say we had been ` ` blown off ' ' would be an understatement .####['service general']
the manager continually interrupted with ` ` is there anything else i can do for you ? ` ` , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .####['service general']
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n ' t bothered to get the waitresses name .####['service general']
in short , schooner or later could n ' t have cared less about our being at their establishment .####['service general']
you are with a hot date and he / she has an urge for sushi . . . then this might be the place .####['food quality']
and they give good quantity for the price .####['food style options', 'food prices']
we were only in seattle for one night and i ' m so glad we picked rays for dinner !####['restaurant general']
this is the case at this gem .####['restaurant general']
you ca n ' t go wrong here .####['restaurant general']
seriously , you ca n ' t go wrong , if it is unpretentious local fun you seek .####['ambience general']
my mouth felt very dry afterwards and i had that signature ? msg ? taste lingering in my throat after i left the restaurant .####['food quality']
they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and not - too - sweet .####['food quality']
the dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip , almost $ 50 / pp after tax and tip ( about average ) .####['restaurant prices', 'service general']
just remember to dress a little urban - chic so you don ? t look too far out of place .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
very good !####['restaurant general']
overpriced####['restaurant prices']
waited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd .####['service general']
not sure if i would go back .####['restaurant general']
in fact , many want to return a second time during their visit .####['restaurant general']
they are n ' t the most talkative , but everytime i ' ve been there they have been very busy , which probably accounts for the lack of conversation .####['service general']
it ' s just the right size for the menu .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
excellent####['restaurant general']
you never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there .####['food quality']
the pizza ' s are light and scrumptious .####['food quality']
worth the wait####['restaurant general']
– had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning , but it was so worth it .####['restaurant general', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
go with some friends , wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe , and enjoy more than your average breakfast .####['restaurant general', 'food quality']
i do n ' t know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place .####['restaurant general']
donot go !####['restaurant general']
delicious####['food quality']
we waited for an hour to be seated .####['service general']
it was worth the wait .####['restaurant general']
plan on waiting 30 - 70 minutes .####['service general']
will definitely be back .####['restaurant general']
delicious . . . !####['food quality']
delectable####['food quality']
once you ' re inside , the real experience begins .####['restaurant general']
i probably would n ' t go back though ' cuz i do n ' t know if it ' s worth it .####['restaurant general']
maybe i ' ll go back once more many years from now when i ' ve forgotten i went there already .####['restaurant general']
sit in the balcony####['ambience general']
– not bad .####['restaurant general']
although the service could be improved considering the money you put in .####['restaurant prices', 'service general']
our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times .####['service general']
should check - up on us more frequently , do n ' t you think ?####['service general']
the most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places .####['restaurant prices']
i felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
this place rocks ! !####['restaurant general']
the chips and salsa are so yummy , and the prices are fabulous .####['restaurant prices', 'food quality']
the atmosphere is aspiring , and the decor is festive and amazing . .####['ambience general']
insultingly overpriced####['restaurant prices']
- mediocre service / quality####['service general']
to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .####['service general']
two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner . . . they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
all considered , i have to say that ray ' s boathouse is deserving of its title as a seattle institution .####['restaurant general']
