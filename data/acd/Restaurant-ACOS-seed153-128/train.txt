the hostess was very pleasant .####['service general']
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .####['service general']
very ` ` normal indian food ' ' , but done really well .####['food style options', 'food quality']
also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .####['service general']
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .####['service general', 'food quality']

i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####['restaurant general']
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .####['food style options']
