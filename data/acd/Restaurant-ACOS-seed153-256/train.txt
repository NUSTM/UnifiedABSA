the place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it ' s great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
the decor in this place is very diner - ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .####['ambience general']
our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .####['ambience general']
and really large portions .####['food style options']
drinks way over priced .####['drinks prices']
delivery is fast too .####['service general']
ess - a - bagel ( either by sty - town or midtown ) is by far the best bagel in ny .####['food quality']
i thought this place was totally overrated .####['restaurant general']
the atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo .####['ambience general']
the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food .####['service general', 'restaurant prices', 'food quality']
try green curry with vegetables .####['food quality']
although the tables may be closely situated , the candle - light , food - quality and service overcompensate .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'food quality']
the service was excellent - friendly and attentive .####['service general']
the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .####['service general']

waitstaff are very friendly .####['service general']
the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .####['service general', 'ambience general']
the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .####['restaurant prices']
i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .####['restaurant general']
they do n ' t concern much of customer ' s health , just want to make money .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
please do n ' t fool us .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
of course , it is crowded but who cares .####['ambience general']
the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .####['service general']
after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from . . . maybe you dont know how things work in america . . . and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .####['service general']
we did tip , i guess the model / waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager .####['service general']
i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .####['restaurant general']
considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time , the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed .####['service general']
nice family owned traditional restaurant .####['restaurant general']
i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .####['food quality']

kind , attentive wait staff .####['service general']
they ' re rude at times , and not very friendly .####['service general']
calling the place hampton chutney co . does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'restaurant general']

great sushi experience .####['food quality']
unique apppetizers .####['food quality']

a few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards .####['food quality']
the pad se ew chicken was delicious , however the pad thai was far too oily .####['food quality']
this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .####['service general']
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !####['service general']
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .####['service general']
never fails to please .####['restaurant general']
service is fast and friendly .####['service general']
but after last night , spice grill is the only place i ' m eating indian cuisine .####['food quality']
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .####['ambience general']
the restaurant has a family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single - handedly solved third world famine .####['food style options', 'ambience general']
a pleasant surprise .####['restaurant general']

all the people that i bring there go back on their own and bring their friends !####['restaurant miscellaneous']

whoever the jazz duo was , they were on point .####['ambience general']
even the wine by the glass was good .####['drinks quality']
was n ' t going to share but i feel obligated . . . while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing .####['food quality']
this place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps queens ' biggest secret !####['restaurant general']
fabulous decor - makes you feel like you ' re in a trendy manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply - priced , generally friendly staff , and if you ' re a manhattanite , or spend most of your time in manhattan , rice avenue will make you feel at home . . . . . very soho / village / upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele . . . . . all on roosevelt avenue !####['service general', 'ambience general', 'food prices', 'restaurant prices', 'location general', 'food quality']
one would think we ' d get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n ' t even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .####['service general']
baluchi ' s has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .####['ambience general', 'restaurant prices', 'food quality']

everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome .####['service general']
food was luke warm .####['food quality']
i do not think dinner in manhattan should cost $ 400 . 00 where i am not swept off my feet .####['food prices']
if you do n ' t like it , i do n ' t know what to tell you .####['food quality']
an unpretentious spot in park slope , the sushi is consistently good , the service is pleasant , effective and unassuming .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'food quality']

the floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .####['ambience general']
the bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the ` ` free ' ' appetizer of olives was disappointing .####['food quality']
when we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .####['service general']
all in all , i would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'restaurant general']
servers are all different , greg is my favorite .####['service general']
prices are fair across the board for both food and bev .####['food prices', 'drinks prices']
we were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .####['ambience general']
maggot in the food !####['food quality']
nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that ' s when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .####['food quality']
i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .####['service general']
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .####['food quality']
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'service general']
the atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .####['ambience general']
if you ' re into being lost when you ' re just five feet from your table then hey , that ' s a good thing .####['ambience general']
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .####['food quality']

i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
the hostess was very pleasant .####['service general']
our experience did not ever get any better .####['restaurant general']
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .####['service general']
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .####['service general']
i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .####['food prices', 'food quality']
the food arrived in about 15 minutes .####['service general']
very ` ` normal indian food ' ' , but done really well .####['food style options', 'food quality']
also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .####['service general']
bukhara is on my top 5 indian places in nyc####['restaurant general']
wretched and retching####['restaurant general']
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .####['service general', 'food quality']
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet .####['food quality']
i book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .####['ambience general', 'food quality']

my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .####['food quality']
we were charged full price .####['service general']
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza####['restaurant general', 'food quality']
the crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####['food quality']
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate decor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city .####['ambience general', 'location general']
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .####['food quality']
terrible would be a compliment !####['restaurant general']
restaurant with a view####['location general']
a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it .####['restaurant general']
our waitress was n ' t mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####['service general']
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####['restaurant general']
dumbfoundingly poor####['restaurant general']
on that scale , it ' s a world - beater .####['restaurant general']
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .####['food style options']
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n ' t say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .####['service general']
no desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !####['service general']

i ' ll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .####['ambience general', 'food quality']
i ' d be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !####['service general']
i ' m a friendly person , so i would n ' t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .####['service general']
his response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .####['service general']
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner .####['restaurant general']
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .####['service general']
she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .####['service general']
