best indian restaurant in the city####['restaurant general']
what really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices , and all made in - house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .####['food quality']
the best !####['restaurant general']

the floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .####['ambience general']
good experience####['restaurant general']
the bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the ` ` free ' ' appetizer of olives was disappointing .####['food quality']
when we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .####['service general']
all in all , i would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'restaurant general']
short and sweet – seating is great : it ' s romantic , cozy and private .####['ambience general']
noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food i enjoy .####['service general', 'food quality']

we were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .####['ambience general']
maggot in the food !####['food quality']
the menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .####['food style options', 'service general', 'food quality']
nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that ' s when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .####['food quality']
i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .####['service general']
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .####['food quality']
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'service general']
it ' s a great place to order from or sit - in .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
the atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .####['ambience general']
if you ' re into being lost when you ' re just five feet from your table then hey , that ' s a good thing .####['ambience general']
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .####['food quality']

but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n ' t include wine ?####['food prices']
what you are paying for is the environment and the name .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'ambience general', 'restaurant prices']
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef .####['food quality']
vanison was good but not amazing .####['food quality']
i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table .####['service general']
the place is beautiful !####['ambience general']
the hostess was very pleasant .####['service general']
our experience did not ever get any better .####['restaurant general']
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .####['service general']
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .####['service general']
i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .####['food prices', 'food quality']
the food arrived in about 15 minutes .####['service general']
everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice !####['food style options', 'food quality']
probably would not go back here .####['restaurant general']
very ` ` normal indian food ' ' , but done really well .####['food style options', 'food quality']
also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .####['service general']
but if you ' re prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for indian food####['restaurant prices', 'food quality']
bukhara is on my top 5 indian places in nyc####['restaurant general']
wretched and retching####['restaurant general']
i have never been so disgusted by both food an service .####['service general', 'food quality']
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .####['service general', 'food quality']
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet .####['food quality']
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####['service general', 'food quality']
i book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .####['ambience general', 'food quality']

more williamsburg garbage####['restaurant general']
the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart .####['service general']
too bad i had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .####['food prices']
as to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made .####['service general']
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .####['food quality']
we were charged full price .####['service general']
it was well worth the wait .####['restaurant general']
the wife had the risotto which was amazing .####['food quality']
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .####['food quality']
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza####['restaurant general', 'food quality']
the crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####['food quality']
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate decor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city .####['ambience general', 'location general']
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .####['food quality']
the entrees were served with miso soup and rice .####['food style options']
for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .####['food quality']
terrible would be a compliment !####['restaurant general']
we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing ! !####['service general']
i love it .####['restaurant general']
the meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .####['food style options', 'food prices', 'service general', 'food quality']
restaurant with a view####['location general']
the food tasted very good .####['food quality']
just want to warn you all - do n ' t waste your time and money .####['restaurant general']
good food####['food quality']
a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it .####['restaurant general']
our waitress was n ' t mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####['service general']
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####['restaurant general']
regardless , we ' ll be back and ca n ' t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
dumbfoundingly poor####['restaurant general']
lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn .####['service general']
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####['service general', 'food quality']
on that scale , it ' s a world - beater .####['restaurant general']
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .####['food style options']
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n ' t say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .####['service general']
guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , ` ` oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier ' ' no apology , nothing .####['service general']
no desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !####['service general']
the level of rudeness was preposterous .####['service general']
cirspy crust margherita pizza####['food quality']
i ' ll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .####['ambience general', 'food quality']
if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this place .####['restaurant general']
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
only complaint is the pricing - - i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .####['food prices']
as bfc does n ' t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'service general']
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she ` ` had a bbq to go to ' ' that night - wtf ? ?####['service general']
i ' d be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !####['service general']
i ' m a friendly person , so i would n ' t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .####['service general']
considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service .####['service general', 'restaurant prices']
maitre - d - ' ' eat and get out ' '####['service general']
his response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .####['service general']
the four seasons restaurant is a great experience .####['restaurant general']
everyone must come here at least once .####['restaurant general']
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at bark you do n ' t just get your average hot dog .####['restaurant prices', 'food quality']
i highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .####['food quality']
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner .####['restaurant general']
never got an explanation as to what was going on .####['service general']
on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .####['service general']
we did n ' t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .####['service general']
she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .####['service general']
