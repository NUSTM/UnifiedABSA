i expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu .####['food prices', 'food quality']
they ' re rude at times , and not very friendly .####['service general']

everything on the menu is great .####['food quality']
the hostess was very pleasant .####['service general']
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .####['service general', 'food quality']
the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart .####['service general']
too bad i had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .####['food prices']
as to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made .####['service general']
the crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####['food quality']
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate decor will make you feel like you â€™ re no longer in the city .####['location general', 'ambience general']
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .####['food style options']
