in the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , ny crowd .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
i ' m going back .####['restaurant general']
the service varys from day to day - sometimes they ' re very nice , and sometimes not .####['service general']
this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain parisian flair .####['ambience general']
however , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !####['ambience general', 'food quality']
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn .####['restaurant general']
the combination of super - fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious .####['food quality']
we were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .####['service general']
the atmosphere is n ' t the greatest , but i suppose that ' s how they keep the prices down .####['restaurant prices', 'ambience general']
it ' s all about the food ! !####['food quality']
i take all my nyc guests to vt ' s .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
i loved everythig about it - especially the shows and actors .####['restaurant general', 'ambience general']
my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .####['food quality']
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .####['food quality']
the service was the only thing good about this restaurant .####['restaurant general', 'service general']

ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .####['food quality']
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i ' ve had at this price range .####['food style options', 'food prices', 'food quality']
i recently went to this restaurant with some co - workers for lunch and had an amazing time .####['restaurant general']
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .####['service general', 'food quality']
the sushi is amazing ! ! !####['food quality']
my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !####['restaurant general']
no gimmicks here - - the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation .####['food quality']
the service was impeccable and unobtrusive - - the staff knows what they are there to do - - to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .####['service general']
we did n ' t want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of korbett it was just enough .####['drinks style options']
it ' s cuz it ' s so good you need to taste it ! ! !####['food quality']
we will definitely go back .####['restaurant general']
we ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .####['food quality']
this restaurant was recommended by a local . . . as a matter of fact , he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed !####['restaurant general']
we were n ' t !####['restaurant general']
there is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me .####['food style options']
the quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .####['food style options']
i am happy i did the food was awsome .####['food quality']
and yes dal bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .####['food quality']
the all - u - can - eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .####['food quality']
i look forward to eating here again####['restaurant general']
try the pad thai , it ' s fabulous and their prices are so cheap !####['restaurant prices', 'food quality']
eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it ' s a very disappointing experience .####['restaurant general', 'ambience general']
fish is so very fresh .####['food quality']
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .####['food quality']
decor is charming .####['ambience general']
the food is great and reasonably priced .####['food prices', 'food quality']
considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time , the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed .####['service general']
we ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it ' s cool and the music is hear well there .####['ambience general']
but the service was a bit slow .####['service general']
it was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami - but it did n ' t have much taste - i ' ve had better for less elsewhere !####['food prices', 'food quality']
the pesto pizza was excellent , thin - crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy italian cheese that i ' d never heard of before .####['food quality']
they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .####['service general']
warning : you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu !####['restaurant general']
wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !####['drinks quality']
calling the place hampton chutney co . does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .####['restaurant general', 'service general', 'ambience general']
this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .####['restaurant general']
would never go back there .####['restaurant general']
i can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .####['restaurant general']
the setting is casual and romantic .####['ambience general']
the rest of the dim sum , though pricey by chinatown standards , is worth it .####['food prices']
the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n ' t like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'service general', 'ambience general']
but that is highly forgivable .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
it ' s a perfect place to have a amazing indian food .####['food quality']
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .####['ambience general']
( always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer ! ! !####['drinks quality']
cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .####['ambience general']
they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips - good but a far cry from what the name implies .####['food quality']
i ca n ' t wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .####['ambience general']
great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .####['restaurant general', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
probably would not go again . . .####['restaurant general']
it was the first place we ate on our first trip to new york , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to new york .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
go here for the drinks !####['drinks quality']
ca n ' t wait to go back .####['restaurant general']
service is not what you are coming here for . . .####['service general']
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on point .####['ambience general']
although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .####['service general', 'ambience general']
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .####['food style options']
the pizza was pretty good and huge .####['food style options', 'food quality']
super yummy pizza !####['food quality']
we had half / half pizza , mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza !####['food style options']
have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once .####['service general']
delivery guy sometimes get upset if you do n ' t tip more than 10 % .####['service general']
its just a fun place to go , not a five star restaraunt .####['restaurant general']
the food was excellent as well as service , however , i left the four seasons very dissappointed .####['restaurant general', 'service general', 'food quality']
mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .####['drinks quality']
the food was good , the place was clean and affordable .####['restaurant prices', 'ambience general', 'food quality']
i noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place !####['restaurant miscellaneous']
the staff is very good .####['service general']
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm so delicious####['food quality']
pacifico is a great place to casually hang out .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come - - if you do n ' t eat one your trip was wasted .####['food quality']
the bar drinks were eh , ok to say the least .####['drinks quality']
the service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .####['service general']
over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .####['ambience general', 'food quality']
will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try at least once .####['restaurant general']
best dining experience in the west village !####['restaurant general']
stepping into casa la femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in new york !####['restaurant general']
maggot in the food !####['food quality']
one special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !####['food style options', 'food quality']
i was so stunned , and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .####['restaurant general']
amazing my favorite ! ! !####['restaurant general']
i came across village underground by accident , now i go there all the time .####['restaurant general']
but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n ' t include wine ?####['food prices']
what you are paying for is the environment and the name .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'ambience general']
for each course we waited over 1 / 2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .####['service general']
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !####['restaurant prices', 'food quality']
i wish i could be refunded !####['restaurant general']
the lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .####['food style options']
everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice !####['food style options', 'food quality']
one of the best####['restaurant general']
however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it ' s your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####['food quality']
it was n ' t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it ' s simply repulsive .####['restaurant general']
if you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .####['ambience general']
but for the shabu shabu , you wo n ' t find much better in ny .####['food quality']
the meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .####['food style options', 'service general', 'food prices', 'food quality']
just want to warn you all - do n ' t waste your time and money .####['restaurant general']
over all it was a very nice romantic place .####['restaurant general', 'ambience general']
again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !####['service general']
considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service .####['restaurant prices', 'service general']
so , if you ' re walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who ' s going to be seating you first . . .####['service general']
this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .####['service general']
i highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .####['food quality']
poor service and management####['service general']
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner .####['restaurant general']
never got an explanation as to what was going on .####['service general']
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .####['restaurant general']
we did n ' t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
bad staff####['service general']
the design of the space is good .####['ambience general']
