the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it .####['food quality']
this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain parisian flair .####['ambience general']

this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn .####['restaurant general']
the combination of super - fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious .####['food quality']
best pastrami i ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .####['food style options', 'food quality']

i went there for lunch and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read .####['food quality']
there was a small wait , but shorter than i expected .####['service general']

over 100 different choices to create your own .####['food style options']
worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt - in - your - mouth experience ) .####['food quality']
seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .####['service general']
the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .####['service general']
i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !####['restaurant general']
other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .####['food quality']
my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .####['food quality']
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .####['food quality']

keep up the good work .####['restaurant general']
ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .####['food quality']
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i ' ve had at this price range .####['food style options', 'food prices', 'food quality']

no gimmicks here - - the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation .####['food quality']
the service was impeccable and unobtrusive - - the staff knows what they are there to do - - to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .####['service general']
it was divine melts in your mouth .####['food quality']
we did n ' t want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of korbett it was just enough .####['drinks style options']

we will definitely go back .####['restaurant general']
please be aware that it ' s cash or amex only !####['restaurant miscellaneous']
we ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .####['food quality']
this place is so much fun .####['ambience general']
it is very overpriced and not very tasty .####['food prices', 'food quality']
everything we had was good or ok . . . . but definitely nothing great .####['food quality']
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'ambience general']
this restaurant was recommended by a local . . . as a matter of fact , he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed !####['restaurant general']
we were n ' t !####['restaurant general']
there is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me .####['food style options']
the quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .####['food style options']
although the tables may be closely situated , the candle - light , food - quality and service overcompensate .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'food quality']
a guaranteeed delight !####['restaurant general']
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !####['restaurant general']
i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .####['food prices', 'food quality']
i am happy i did the food was awsome .####['food quality']
and yes dal bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .####['food quality']
the all - u - can - eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .####['food quality']
the dinner was ok , nothing i would have again .####['food quality']
i look forward to eating here again####['restaurant general']
try the pad thai , it ' s fabulous and their prices are so cheap !####['restaurant prices', 'food quality']
just because it ' s cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , it is great !####['food style options', 'restaurant prices', 'food quality']
eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it ' s a very disappointing experience .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .####['ambience general']
this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
fish is so very fresh .####['food quality']
the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .####['restaurant prices']
i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .####['restaurant general']
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .####['food quality']
definitely a neighborhood favorite .####['restaurant general']
the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .####['service general']
decor is charming .####['ambience general']
i absolutely loved this place .####['restaurant general']
i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .####['restaurant general']
the food is great and reasonably priced .####['food prices', 'food quality']
considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time , the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed .####['service general']
we ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it ' s cool and the music is hear well there .####['ambience general']
but the service was a bit slow .####['service general']
i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .####['food quality']
my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !####['food style options']
it was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami - but it did n ' t have much taste - i ' ve had better for less elsewhere !####['food prices', 'food quality']

i ' ve lived in ny for 5 years and this place has it all .####['restaurant general']
they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .####['service general']
go here .####['restaurant general']
however , it is jus too good to not praise it .####['restaurant general']
warning : you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu !####['restaurant general']
wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !####['drinks quality']
kind , attentive wait staff .####['service general']
their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit - inducing , yuck .####['food quality']
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .####['food quality']
calling the place hampton chutney co . does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'restaurant general']
seriously , this place kicks ass .####['restaurant general']
this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .####['restaurant general']
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee ! !####['drinks quality', 'food quality']
a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning !####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !####['service general', 'food quality']
well , this place is so ghetto its not even funny .####['ambience general']
would never go back there .####['restaurant general']
i can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .####['restaurant general']
during the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .####['service general', 'food quality']
the setting is casual and romantic .####['ambience general']
the rest of the dim sum , though pricey by chinatown standards , is worth it .####['food prices']
the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n ' t like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !####['service general']
but that is highly forgivable .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
rao is a good restaurant , but it ' s nothing special .####['restaurant general']
it ' s a perfect place to have a amazing indian food .####['food quality']
the waiter was attentive .####['service general']
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening .####['ambience general']
( always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer ! ! !####['drinks quality']
cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .####['ambience general']
a real dissapointment .####['food quality']
they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips - good but a far cry from what the name implies .####['food quality']
i ca n ' t wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .####['ambience general']
how do you rate home ?####['restaurant miscellaneous']
great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'restaurant general']
probably would not go again . . .####['restaurant general']
it was the first place we ate on our first trip to new york , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to new york .####['restaurant miscellaneous']

my roommate and i love this place .####['restaurant general']
we recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since i had my yorkie with me .####['ambience general']

i loved it and would go again .####['restaurant general']
great indian food and the service is incredible .####['service general', 'food quality']
everyone was more then happy with his choices .####['service general']
service is not what you are coming here for . . .####['service general']
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on point .####['ambience general']
fabulous decor - makes you feel like you ' re in a trendy manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply - priced , generally friendly staff , and if you ' re a manhattanite , or spend most of your time in manhattan , rice avenue will make you feel at home . . . . . very soho / village / upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele . . . . . all on roosevelt avenue !####['service general', 'ambience general', 'food prices', 'restaurant prices', 'location general', 'food quality']
although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .####['service general', 'ambience general']
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .####['food style options']

the pizza was pretty good and huge .####['food style options', 'food quality']

over the years the host , vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family - - although with all the business this not - so - little gem does , it amazing he ' s even able to remember a consistent but not - so - frequent visitor .####['service general']
super yummy pizza !####['food quality']
i was visiting new york city with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant .####['ambience general']

not cheap but very yummy .####['food prices', 'food quality']
very , very nice####['restaurant general']
there are no negatives to speak of .####['restaurant general']

food was luke warm .####['food quality']
the food was excellent as well as service , however , i left the four seasons very dissappointed .####['service general', 'restaurant general', 'food quality']
i do not think dinner in manhattan should cost $ 400 . 00 where i am not swept off my feet .####['food prices']
an unpretentious spot in park slope , the sushi is consistently good , the service is pleasant , effective and unassuming .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'food quality']
do n ' t get me started on the margaritas , either .####['drinks quality']
mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .####['drinks quality']
the food was good , the place was clean and affordable .####['ambience general', 'restaurant prices', 'food quality']

a beautifully designed dreamy egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night .####['ambience general']
pacifico is a great place to casually hang out .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come - - if you do n ' t eat one your trip was wasted .####['food quality']
this place is a must visit !####['restaurant general']
the food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together .####['food style options']
i ' ve enjoyed 99 % of the dishes we ' ve ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too - authentic - for - me dish ( i ' m a daring eater but not that daring ) .####['food quality']
service was wonderful ;####['service general']
the bar drinks were eh , ok to say the least .####['drinks quality']
i had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations .####['food quality']
the service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .####['service general']
over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .####['ambience general', 'food quality']
will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try at least once .####['restaurant general']
prices are fair across the board for both food and bev .####['food prices', 'drinks prices']
i go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .####['service general']
best dining experience in the west village !####['restaurant general']
stepping into casa la femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in new york !####['restaurant general']
maggot in the food !####['food quality']
i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .####['service general']
the manager finally said he would com # # p the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .####['service general']
i got hair in my food 2 times of then !####['food quality']
very pleased####['restaurant general']
one special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !####['food style options', 'food quality']
great food !####['food quality']
i was so stunned , and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .####['restaurant general']
this place survives on reputation alone .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
amazing my favorite ! ! !####['restaurant general']
i came across village underground by accident , now i go there all the time .####['restaurant general']
the dj is awesome , i have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and i keep going back .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n ' t include wine ?####['food prices']
what you are paying for is the environment and the name .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'ambience general', 'restaurant prices']
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef .####['food quality']
service was just ok , it is not what you ' d expect for $ 500 .####['service general', 'restaurant prices']
terrible waste of money . . scammers####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
although we were told 10 - 15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .####['service general']
for each course we waited over 1 / 2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .####['service general']
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !####['service general']
to top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .####['service general', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !####['restaurant prices', 'food quality']
i wish i could be refunded !####['restaurant general']
the lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .####['food style options']
everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice !####['food style options', 'food quality']
one of the best####['restaurant general']
however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it ' s your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####['food quality']
it was n ' t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it ' s simply repulsive .####['restaurant general']
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza####['restaurant general', 'food quality']
a quintessential slice of nyc pizza .####['food quality']
if you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .####['ambience general']
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .####['food quality']
but for the shabu shabu , you wo n ' t find much better in ny .####['food quality']
the meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .####['food style options', 'food prices', 'service general', 'food quality']
just want to warn you all - do n ' t waste your time and money .####['restaurant general']
over all it was a very nice romantic place .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
regardless , we ' ll be back and ca n ' t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !####['service general']
this place . . . god where do i begin .####['restaurant general']
the hot dogs are top notch , and they ' re slamwich is amazing !####['food quality']
considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service .####['service general', 'restaurant prices']
so , if you ' re walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who ' s going to be seating you first . . .####['service general']
this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .####['service general']
i highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .####['food quality']
cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .####['ambience general']
poor service and management####['service general']
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner .####['restaurant general']
never got an explanation as to what was going on .####['service general']
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .####['restaurant general']
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , ` ` can i help you ' ' and ` ` how many are in your party . ' '####['service general']
we did n ' t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
bad staff####['service general']
the design of the space is good .####['ambience general']
she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .####['service general']
