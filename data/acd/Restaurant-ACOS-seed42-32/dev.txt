the only thing that strikes you is the decor ? ( not very pleasant ) .####['ambience general']
once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !####['service general']

the food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked .####['food quality']
