over 100 different choices to create your own .####['food style options']
the chicken pot pie is exceptional , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .####['food style options', 'service general', 'food quality']

try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .####['food quality']
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt - in - your - mouth experience ) .####['food quality']

seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .####['service general']

my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !####['restaurant general']
the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .####['food style options', 'ambience general', 'drinks prices']
slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .####['drinks quality', 'drinks prices']
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .####['service general']
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n ' t make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .####['restaurant general', 'food quality']
someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .####['food quality']
one of us actually liked the expresso - that ' s it .####['drinks quality']

delivery is fast too .####['service general']
they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .####['food style options', 'food quality']
everything we had was good or ok . . . . but definitely nothing great .####['food quality']
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'ambience general']

this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
the food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu - fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .####['food quality']
although the tables may be closely situated , the candle - light , food - quality and service overcompensate .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'food quality']

i look forward to eating here again####['restaurant general']
planet thai is great !####['restaurant general']
try the pad thai , it ' s fabulous and their prices are so cheap !####['restaurant prices', 'food quality']
just because it ' s cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , it is great !####['food style options', 'restaurant prices', 'food quality']
eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it ' s a very disappointing experience .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
this restaurant is vegetarian ; there are no meat dishes whatsoever .####['food style options']
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .####['ambience general']
this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
fish is so very fresh .####['food quality']
the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .####['restaurant prices']
i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .####['restaurant general']

definitely a neighborhood favorite .####['restaurant general']

decor is charming .####['ambience general']
i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine !####['food quality']

the food is great and reasonably priced .####['food prices', 'food quality']
considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time , the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed .####['service general']
my friends settled for rice dishes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was good . . . not outstanding , but good .####['food quality']
we ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it ' s cool and the music is hear well there .####['ambience general']
the place was nice and calm .####['ambience general']
but the service was a bit slow .####['service general']
i would go back .####['restaurant general']
i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .####['food quality']
my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !####['food style options']

however , it is jus too good to not praise it .####['restaurant general']
the crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .####['service general', 'food quality']
we all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in new york .####['restaurant general']
all of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !####['restaurant prices', 'food quality']
the first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .####['food quality']
not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .####['service general', 'food quality']
warning : you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu !####['restaurant general']
the entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .####['food style options', 'food quality']
wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well !####['drinks quality']
kind , attentive wait staff .####['service general']
delicious crab cakes too .####['food quality']
their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit - inducing , yuck .####['food quality']
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .####['food quality']
the counter service is bad .####['service general']
anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary .####['food quality']
calling the place hampton chutney co . does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'restaurant general']

the atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'food quality']
murray wo n ' t do it .####['service general']
so close , but not good enough .####['restaurant general']
do n ' t be fooled by crowds of people .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
it hits the spot every time####['restaurant general']
this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .####['restaurant general']
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee ! !####['drinks quality', 'food quality']
a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning !####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !####['service general', 'food quality']
furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .####['food quality']
the location is perfect .####['location general']
give it a try and enjoy .####['restaurant general']
well , this place is so ghetto its not even funny .####['ambience general']

you ca n ' t go wrong with this place .####['restaurant general']
suan is a great place that i often take my friends ( classmates ) too .####['restaurant general']
i can not imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant .####['service general']
i can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .####['restaurant general']
during the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .####['service general', 'food quality']
i wish they would change back to what it was before .####['restaurant general']
the setting is casual and romantic .####['ambience general']
the rest of the dim sum , though pricey by chinatown standards , is worth it .####['food prices']
the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n ' t like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !####['service general']
terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut - down .####['service general', 'restaurant general']
only drawback - they wo n ' t toast your bagel , and they do n ' t make eggs for the bagel .####['service general']
but that is highly forgivable .####['restaurant miscellaneous']

my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle .####['food quality']
a real dissapointment .####['food quality']
but that was n ' t the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had .####['food quality']
they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips - good but a far cry from what the name implies .####['food quality']
i ca n ' t wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .####['ambience general']
i have to say that i am pleasantly suprised and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neighborhood .####['restaurant general']

go here for the drinks !####['drinks quality']
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .####['drinks quality', 'drinks prices']
this is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .####['food quality']

good experience####['restaurant general']
the bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the ` ` free ' ' appetizer of olives was disappointing .####['food quality']
i had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations .####['food quality']
when we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .####['service general']
all in all , i would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'restaurant general']
the service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .####['service general']
over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .####['ambience general', 'food quality']
so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food .####['ambience general', 'restaurant prices', 'food quality']
will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try at least once .####['restaurant general']
servers are all different , greg is my favorite .####['service general']

i never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !####['restaurant general']
maggot in the food !####['food quality']
i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .####['service general']
the manager finally said he would com # # p the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .####['service general']
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'service general']
unhygienic####['food quality']

patsy ' s pizza = true love####['restaurant general']

i came across village underground by accident , now i go there all the time .####['restaurant general']
the dj is awesome , i have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and i keep going back .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
you can get a table without a reservation if you get there early i they do n ' t make you by bottles .####['service general']
wish ny had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general', 'food quality']
but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n ' t include wine ?####['food prices']
ca n ' t argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .####['food prices']
what you are paying for is the environment and the name .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'ambience general', 'restaurant prices']
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef .####['food quality']
you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .####['service general']
service was just ok , it is not what you ' d expect for $ 500 .####['service general', 'restaurant prices']
terrible waste of money . . scammers####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table .####['service general']
although we were told 10 - 15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .####['service general']
for each course we waited over 1 / 2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .####['service general']
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka .####['service general']
we asked for beverages and never received them .####['service general']
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !####['service general']
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !####['service general']
to top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .####['service general', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !####['restaurant prices', 'food quality']
i wish i could be refunded !####['restaurant general']
there was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .####['drinks style options']
the lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .####['food style options']
everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice !####['food style options', 'food quality']
they seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her fork in hand ) .####['service general']
food was amazing - i love indian food and eat it quite regularly , but i can say this is one of the best i ' ve had .####['food quality']
one of the best####['restaurant general']
bukhara grill , the tagline says it all . . ` ` indian spice rave ' '####['restaurant general']
the lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .####['food prices']
bukhara is on my top 5 indian places in nyc####['restaurant general']
however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it ' s your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####['food quality']
none was made so i hung up .####['service general']
it was n ' t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it ' s simply repulsive .####['restaurant general']
gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'ambience general']
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .####['food quality']
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza####['restaurant general', 'food quality']
a quintessential slice of nyc pizza .####['food quality']
if you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .####['ambience general']
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .####['food quality']
terrible would be a compliment !####['restaurant general']
they are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !####['service general', 'food prices', 'drinks prices']
great shabu shabu####['food quality']

just want to warn you all - do n ' t waste your time and money .####['restaurant general']
over all it was a very nice romantic place .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
regardless , we ' ll be back and ca n ' t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
dumbfoundingly poor####['restaurant general']
lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn .####['service general']
the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .####['service general']
polite acknowledgement is out ;####['service general']
overall the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n ' t sat cooling in front of the guest .####['service general', 'food quality']
the place has a nice fit - out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins )####['service general', 'ambience general', 'drinks style options']
at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you ' re looking to pay by the hour for passive - aggressive torture .####['service general', 'restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
how is this palce still open ?####['restaurant general']
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n ' t say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .####['service general']
again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !####['service general']
the level of rudeness was preposterous .####['service general']
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .####['service general', 'drinks quality', 'food quality']
cirspy crust margherita pizza####['food quality']
this place . . . god where do i begin .####['restaurant general']
the hot dogs are top notch , and they ' re slamwich is amazing !####['food quality']
it ' s a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we ' ve eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .####['restaurant prices']
i ' m a friendly person , so i would n ' t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .####['service general']
considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service .####['service general', 'restaurant prices']
so , if you ' re walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who ' s going to be seating you first . . .####['service general']
this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .####['service general']
if you go here , do it on his off - night .####['service general']
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening .####['food quality']
i highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .####['food quality']
cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .####['ambience general']
poor service and management####['service general']
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner .####['restaurant general']
never got an explanation as to what was going on .####['service general']
the pasta was well cooked , did n ' t have enough sauce though or flavor .####['food quality']
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .####['restaurant general']
the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .####['service general']
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , ` ` can i help you ' ' and ` ` how many are in your party . ' '####['service general']
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .####['service general']
we did n ' t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
bad staff####['service general']
the design of the space is good .####['ambience general']
the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .####['service general']
i ca n ' t believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !####['service general']
she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .####['service general']
