every time i have a special occasion with my boyfriend i have a hard time going anywhere else .####['restaurant miscellaneous']

everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .####['service general']
paul , the maitre d ' , was totally professional and always on top of things .####['service general']
would not go back .####['restaurant general']
we thought the dessert would be better , wrong !####['food quality']
the wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings .####['service general', 'drinks style options']
the dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .####['service general', 'food quality']
short and sweet – seating is great : it ' s romantic , cozy and private .####['ambience general']
so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food .####['ambience general', 'restaurant prices', 'food quality']
will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try at least once .####['restaurant general']
prices are fair across the board for both food and bev .####['food prices', 'drinks prices']

the have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for !####['drinks quality']
nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that ' s when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .####['food quality']
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .####['food quality']
unhygienic####['food quality']
i do not recommend .####['restaurant general']
awesome####['restaurant general']
good creative rolls !####['food style options', 'food quality']
yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi , or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
the appetizers are also delicious !####['food quality']
despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go - to for modern japanese food for the foreseeable future .####['ambience general', 'food quality']
the chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( i have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the chilli chicken .####['food quality']
hands down the best pizza on the planet .####['food quality']
in about 12 minutes , the thing is gone .####['food quality']
great taste####['food quality']
helpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .####['service general', 'food prices']
the flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal .####['food prices', 'food quality']
be prepared to wait , because the place is pretty tiny .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'ambience general']

amazing my favorite ! ! !####['restaurant general']
which lets face it . . . . at times it ' s a good thing .####['service general']
everything on the menu is great .####['food quality']
this establishment is the real deal .####['restaurant general']
wish ny had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general', 'food quality']
look , the appetizers were really good .####['food quality']
the entree was also very good .####['food quality']
service was just ok , it is not what you ' d expect for $ 500 .####['service general', 'restaurant prices']
terrible waste of money . . scammers####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
our experience did not ever get any better .####['restaurant general']
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .####['service general']
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .####['food quality']
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka !####['service general']
my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended . . . and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly !####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general', 'service general']
there was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .####['drinks style options']
not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with brahma .####['drinks style options']
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .####['food style options', 'service general', 'food quality']
the food arrived in about 15 minutes .####['service general']
all in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh .####['food prices', 'food quality']
service not the friendliest to our ` ` large party ' ' !####['service general']
one of the best####['restaurant general']
bukhara is on my top 5 indian places in nyc####['restaurant general']
for starters they delivered us someone else ' s order .####['service general']
however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it ' s your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####['food quality']
none was made so i hung up .####['service general']
the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart .####['service general']
the bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n ' t even close to sizzling .####['food quality']
easily the worst stir - fried squid i ' ve ever tasted .####['food quality']
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean .####['food quality']
the side dishes were passable , and i did get a refill upon request .####['food quality']
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .####['food quality']
love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go .####['restaurant general']
personally i like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .####['food quality']
if you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .####['ambience general']
my party had the bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !####['food style options', 'food prices']
for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .####['food quality']
we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing ! !####['service general']
we never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .####['service general']
they are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !####['service general', 'food prices', 'drinks prices']
i love it .####['restaurant general']
but for the shabu shabu , you wo n ' t find much better in ny .####['food quality']
the meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .####['food style options', 'food prices', 'service general', 'food quality']
the hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .####['food quality']
the main entree was also very good .####['food quality']
this place does n ' t make any sense####['restaurant general']
just want to warn you all - do n ' t waste your time and money .####['restaurant general']
over all it was a very nice romantic place .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
loved it####['restaurant general']
a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it .####['restaurant general']
our waitress was n ' t mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####['service general']
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####['restaurant general']
this was , from start to finish , a mind - bogglingly uncomfortable experience .####['restaurant general']
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####['service general', 'food quality']
at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you ' re looking to pay by the hour for passive - aggressive torture .####['service general', 'restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms .####['food prices', 'food quality']
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n ' t say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .####['service general']
so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it .####['food quality']
after that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !####['service general']
no desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !####['service general']
this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it ' s a matter of taste that she did n ' t like it , and i can not comp it .####['service general']
this staff should be fired .####['service general']
cirspy crust margherita pizza####['food quality']
it was really good pizza .####['food quality']
if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this place .####['restaurant general']
well . . . they can run but they ca n ' t hide .####['restaurant general']
only complaint is the pricing - - i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .####['food prices']
fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n ' t put you off –####['service general', 'food quality']
each time we ' ve been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they ' re fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .####['service general', 'food quality']
as bfc does n ' t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'service general']
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she ` ` had a bbq to go to ' ' that night - wtf ? ?####['service general']
i ' m a friendly person , so i would n ' t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .####['service general']
again , i ' d be super upset if that were my employee .####['service general']
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening .####['food quality']
the four seasons restaurant is a great experience .####['restaurant general']
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at bark you do n ' t just get your average hot dog .####['restaurant prices', 'food quality']
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner .####['restaurant general']
never got an explanation as to what was going on .####['service general']
on the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .####['service general']
the food is very good , but not outstanding .####['food quality']
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .####['service general', 'food quality']
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .####['restaurant general']
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .####['service general']
but the service is horrid !####['service general']
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .####['service general']
