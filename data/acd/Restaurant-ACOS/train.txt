judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .####['restaurant general']
we , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .####['service general']
they never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .####['service general']
the food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .####['food quality', 'food style options']
after all that , they complained to me about the small tip .####['service general']
avoid this place !####['restaurant general']
i have eaten at saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .####['food quality']
saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn .####['restaurant general']
the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .####['food quality']
the wine list is interesting and has many good values .####['drinks prices', 'drinks style options']
for the price , you can not eat this well in manhattan .####['food quality', 'restaurant prices']
i was very disappointed with this restaurant .####['restaurant general']
ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .####['service general']
i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested .####['service general']
food was okay , nothing great .####['food quality']
chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
i / we will never go back to this place again .####['restaurant general']
went on a 3 day oyster binge , with fish bringing up the closing , and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended , because it was so great !####['restaurant general']
service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n ' t be beat ! ! !####['service general', 'food quality', 'restaurant prices']
you ca n ' t go wrong here .####['restaurant general']
every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant saul on smith street .####['restaurant general']
everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .####['service general', 'food quality', 'ambience general']
i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible .####['food quality']
and i hate to say this but i doubt i ' ll ever go back .####['restaurant general']
the food is very average . . . the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here .####['food quality']
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree .####['food quality']
i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty ( could ' ve used a bit more salt ) .####['food quality', 'food style options']
the decor is night tho . . . but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling . . . its quite un - appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .####['ambience general']
we went around 9 : 30 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !####['service general']
the perfect spot .####['restaurant general']
food - awesome .####['food quality']
service - friendly and attentive .####['service general']
ambiance - relaxed and stylish .####['ambience general']
do n ' t judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .####['restaurant general']
the food is decent .####['food quality']
however , it ' s the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .####['service general']
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self - respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i . e . make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .####['service general']
i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i ' m here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .####['service general']
well , i did n ' t find it there , and trust , i have told everyone i can think of about my experience .####['restaurant general']
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty . hmmm .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
i had a great experience .####['restaurant general']
food is great .####['food quality']
service is top notch .####['service general']
i have been going back again and again .####['restaurant general']
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency - not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .####['food quality']
the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .####['food quality', 'food style options']
the rice to fish ration was also good - - they did n ' t try to overpack the rice .####['food style options']
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .####['food quality']
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
in the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , ny crowd .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
the food was well prepared and the service impecable .####['service general', 'food quality']
i ' m going back .####['restaurant general']
quite simply it ' s like stepping out of manhattan and into a haven of tranquility .####['ambience general']
i will be going back and heartily recommend it !####['restaurant general']
it is terrific , as is the value .####['food quality', 'food prices']
$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .####['food quality', 'food prices', 'food style options']
i am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .####['food quality']
go hungry and enjoy .####['restaurant general']
i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda disappointing .####['food quality']
the service varys from day to day - sometimes they ' re very nice , and sometimes not .####['service general']
the kitchen however , is almost always slow .####['service general']
if you ' ve ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .####['location general']
add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .####['service general', 'food quality', 'food prices']
the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it .####['food quality']
once you step into cosette , you ' re miraculously in a small , off - the - beaten path parisian bistro .####['ambience general']
this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain parisian flair .####['ambience general']
the food was average to above - average ; the french onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way .####['food quality']
however , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !####['food quality', 'ambience general']
the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n ' t even fully melted !####['food quality']
it looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .####['food quality']
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn .####['restaurant general']
the pizza is overpriced and soggy .####['food quality', 'food prices']
yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n ' t make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .####['food quality']
a big disappointment , all around .####['restaurant general']
i think i ' ve had some the best meals of my life at minnow .####['food quality']
the seafood is amazing , there ' s a good wine list , and the ever - changing menu always offers some great surprises .####['food quality', 'drinks style options', 'food style options']
the combination of super - fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious .####['food quality']
worth the trip from manhattan .####['restaurant general']
best pastrami i ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .####['food quality', 'food style options']
my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .####['food quality', 'food style options']
as a japanese native , i ' ve lived in the tristate area for over 8 years , but i was just so amazed at this place .####['restaurant general']
this place is the most japanese it can ever get .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
the signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese .####['service general', 'food quality', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'food style options']
this place is worth an one - hour drive .####['restaurant general']
i am so coming back here again , as much as i can .####['restaurant general']
leon is an east village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic french bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .####['food quality', 'ambience general', 'restaurant general']

our teenage kids love it , too .####['restaurant general']
everytime i decide to try another place on the ues , i get angry that i did n ' t just go to zucchero pomodori .####['restaurant general']
this is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood .####['restaurant general']
the service is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions .####['service general', 'food quality', 'ambience general', 'food style options']
i ' m partial to the gnocchi .####['restaurant general']
this place is incredibly tiny .####['ambience general']
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .####['service general']
the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .####['service general']
the food was bland oily .####['food quality']
i just do n ' t understand all the hype . . .####['restaurant general']
we have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .####['service general', 'food quality', 'drinks quality']
we were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .####['service general']
as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .####['drinks quality']
when we sat , we got great and fast service .####['service general']
the people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes .####['service general']
this is a fun restaurant to go to .####['restaurant general']
the pizza is yummy and i like the atmoshpere .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
but the pizza is way to expensive .####['food prices']
a large is $ 20 , and toppings are about $ 3 each .####['food prices']
i went there for lunch and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read .####['food quality']
sauce was watery and the food did n ' t have much flavor .####['food quality']
i do n ' t think i would go again .####['restaurant general']
this place is great .####['restaurant general']
the waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal !####['service general', 'food quality']

planet thailand has always been a hit with me , i go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .####['food quality', 'restaurant general']
with the great variety on the menu , i eat here often and never get bored .####['food style options']
the atmosphere is n ' t the greatest , but i suppose that ' s how they keep the prices down .####['restaurant prices', 'ambience general']
it ' s all about the food ! !####['food quality']
first it took us a long time to find the place .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
but when we looked at the menu , there were n ' t a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .####['food style options']
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n ' t fresh .####['food quality', 'food style options']
they were dry and disgusting , i did n ' t even finish my first piece .####['food quality']
hurley ' s is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came .####['service general']
try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .####['food quality']
try everything for that matter , it is all good .####['food quality']
i have been going there since it opened and i ca n ' t get enough .####['restaurant general']
first went here to enjoy their garden terrace .####['ambience general']
the food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over - bearing or rushed .####['service general', 'food quality']
the steak tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .####['food style options']
admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .####['ambience general']
great wine selection , gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .####['drinks prices', 'drinks style options', 'drinks quality']
it may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
pizza - the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !####['food quality']

i ' ve been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .####['restaurant general']
i ' d highly recommend it for a special occasion - - it provides and intimate setting and nice service .####['service general', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'ambience general']
i ' m not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and i all enjoy mizu very much . . . and we ' re repeat customers .####['restaurant general']
even after they overcharged me the last time i was there .####['service general']
it ' s delicious !####['food quality']
moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was very salty !####['food quality']
took my mom for mother ' s day , and the maitre d ' was pretty rude .####['service general']
told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved .####['service general']
stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting .####['service general']
tiny dessert was $ 8 . 00 . . . just plain overpriced for what it is .####['food quality', 'food prices', 'food style options']
the drinks are always well made and wine selection is fairly priced .####['drinks prices', 'drinks quality']
try their chef ' s specials - - they are to die for .####['food quality']
service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .####['service general']
downstairs lounge is always a good attraction####['ambience general']
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .####['food quality', 'food style options']
it is also extremely well priced .####['food prices']
the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .####['service general']
the bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .####['drinks prices', 'drinks style options']
this is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed .####['restaurant general']
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !####['restaurant general']
when we stumbled on leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem but , we were certainly wrong .####['restaurant general']
the waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet , we were told no . . .####['service general']
then , to top things off , she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend ' s jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes .####['service general']
such a disappointment . . .####['service general']
rude service , medicore food . . . there are tons of restaurants in ny . . . stay away from this one####['service general', 'food quality', 'restaurant general']
i loved everythig about it - especially the shows and actors .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
our server was very helpful and friendly .####['service general']
the food was good too .####['food quality']
the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .####['food quality']
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .####['location general']
inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .####['ambience general']
service was prompt and courteous .####['service general']
this was a repeat visit and we ' ll definitely be back again .####['restaurant general']
great service , great food .####['service general', 'food quality']
prices are in line .####['restaurant prices']
but too far east !####['location general']
the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria ' s .####['food quality']
two complaints - - their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .####['food style options']
also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .####['food quality', 'food style options']
wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws !####['service general', 'food quality']
by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaurant .####['food quality']
over 100 different choices to create your own .####['food style options']
a must try !####['restaurant general']
on a recent sunday afternoon , a friend and i accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt .####['restaurant general']
this was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
the chicken pot pie is exceptional , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .####['service general', 'food quality', 'food style options']
with so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find !####['restaurant general']
the staff is no nonsense .####['service general']
when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .####['food quality']
worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
he served me an uni hand roll , which i never had before , and let me tell you . . . it was heaven !####['food quality']
the sake menu should not be overlooked !####['drinks style options']
all in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .####['restaurant general']
try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .####['food quality']
service was very good - prompt , attentive and non - intrusive .####['service general']
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt - in - your - mouth experience ) .####['food quality']
wine list selection is good and wine - by - the - glass was generously filled to the top .####['drinks style options']
traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .####['ambience general']
i ' ve been to at cafe spice probably 5 - 8 times , it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square .####['restaurant general']
to sum it up : service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average ok .####['service general']
seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .####['service general']
food is usually very good , though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .####['food quality']
as many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .####['service general']
the decor is vibrant and eye - pleasing with several semi - private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .####['ambience general']
i have never been disappointed in the red eye .####['restaurant general']
the first time i went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , i ordered the lobster cobb salad .####['ambience general']
it ' s simply the best meal in nyc .####['food quality']
you can not go wrong at the red eye grill .####['restaurant general']
if we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .####['restaurant general']
the restaurant is cute but not upscale .####['restaurant general']
the food is a diamond in rough - - the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .####['food quality']
i would highly recommend it .####['restaurant general']
it ' s one of our favorite places to eat in ny .####['restaurant general']
we had a great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night .####['restaurant general']
after really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .####['service general']
the place ' s decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .####['ambience general']
i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !####['restaurant general']
if you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
the have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .####['food quality', 'drinks style options']
the entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .####['ambience general']
you will not be disapointed at all .####['restaurant general']
we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem .####['restaurant general']
the bagel was huge .####['food style options']
the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) .####['food style options']
i loved it and would highly recommend .####['restaurant general']
this was my frist time at cafe st . bart ' s and i must say how delicious the food and the service was .####['service general', 'food quality']
i have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster .####['food quality']
other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .####['food quality']
i highly recommend cafe st . bart ' s for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .####['service general', 'food quality', 'ambience general']
all the staff is absolutely professional ! !####['service general']
( that is a must , but not every restaurant can do . . . )####['service general']
there ' s nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .####['ambience general']
this restaurant was way overhyped .####['restaurant general']
my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .####['food quality']
okay - i do n ' t mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland .####['food quality']
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .####['food quality']
the service was the only thing good about this restaurant .####['service general', 'restaurant general']
it ' s boring on the inside , and our sushi was pretty below average . . . the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
i definitely would n ' t go back .####['restaurant general']
their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .####['food quality']
the price is reasonable although the service is poor .####['service general', 'restaurant prices']
great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends . . .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'ambience general']
i will be going back very soon .####['restaurant general']
keep up the good work .####['restaurant general']
it was wonderful .####['restaurant general']
the salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy .####['food quality']
we had pam ' s special fried fish and it was amazing .####['food quality']
too large for just two people but nothing was left .####['food quality', 'food style options']
great vibe , lots of people .####['ambience general']
my husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .####['food quality']
i did n ' t complain , i liked the atmosphere so much .####['ambience general']
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .####['restaurant general']
ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'ambience general']
salads were fantastic .####['food quality']
although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .####['food quality']
ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .####['food quality']
we will be back .####['restaurant general']
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i ' ve had at this price range .####['food quality', 'food prices', 'food style options']
the yellowtail was particularly good as well .####['food quality']
i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however - - the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .####['food prices', 'food style options']
in any event , this is a place i ' ll be sure to stop by again when i ' m in this part of town .####['restaurant general']
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment .####['restaurant general']
they have it all - - great price , food , and service .####['service general', 'food quality', 'restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .####['service general', 'ambience general']
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently .####['service general']
and it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3 - 6 each ) .####['food prices']
the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .####['service general']
enjoyed a very nice caesar salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese . . . . both very tasty .####['food quality']
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .####['service general', 'food quality']
we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .####['food quality']
we ' d go back again####['restaurant general']
i recently went to this restaurant with some co - workers for lunch and had an amazing time .####['restaurant general']
the staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .####['service general', 'food quality', 'ambience general']
we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .####['service general']
yes , the prices are high , but i felt it was worth it .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
we all felt it was worth it .####['restaurant general']
sometimes i get good food and ok service .####['service general', 'food quality']
sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service .####['service general', 'food quality']
it is not consistent .####['restaurant general']
the place is a bistro which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'food style options']
and where does patis go wrong ; no where .####['restaurant general']
you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but : cassuolet , steake fritte , tripe stew , etc ; simple stuff .####['food quality', 'food style options']
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .####['food quality']
my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .####['food quality']
the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .####['drinks quality']
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
overall i would recommend it and go back again .####['restaurant general']
i started out with a bombay beer which was big enough for two .####['drinks style options']
mmmmm . . . it was delicious .####['food quality']
service was slow , but the people were friendly .####['service general']
it ' s a nice place to relax and have conversation .####['ambience general']
i ca n ' t wait to go back .####['restaurant general']
the food is authentic italian - delicious !####['food quality']
pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta .####['food quality']
ambience is delightful , service impeccable .####['service general', 'ambience general']
service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .####['service general', 'ambience general']
do not try unless you ' re just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .####['restaurant general']
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .####['service general', 'food quality']
the filet mignon dish was superb !####['food quality']
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .####['restaurant general']
it ' s a small cute restaurant .####['restaurant general']
i absolutely love this place ! ! !####['restaurant general']
i like the ambience , it ' s very dark and original .####['ambience general']
the sushi is amazing ! ! !####['food quality']
and amazingly cheap .####['food prices']
very affordable and excellent ambient !####['restaurant prices', 'ambience general']
we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai .####['food quality']
we were very disappointed .####['food quality']
we wo n ' t go to this place again for a good meal .####['food quality']
however , i think this place is a good hang out spot .####['ambience general']
my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !####['restaurant general']
they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter , so i ' m looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
check this place out !####['restaurant general']
highly recommended ! ! ! ! !####['restaurant general']
first of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by citysearch ' s editorial review .####['ambience general']
either that , or the editor ' s idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .####['ambience general']
the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .####['drinks prices', 'ambience general', 'food style options']
slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .####['drinks prices', 'drinks quality']
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .####['service general']
for instance , plates were just dumped on the table , i was handed the wine list upside down , etc . . . .####['service general']
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .####['service general']
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n ' t make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .####['food quality', 'restaurant general']
not one of our meals was edible - bland and / or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .####['food quality']
fish was overdone .####['food quality']
cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'restaurant general']
someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .####['food quality']
one of us actually liked the expresso - that ' s it .####['drinks quality']
skip this restaurant , it ' s a big disappointment .####['restaurant general']
myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the city ; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else .####['restaurant general']

the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .####['food quality']
quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi i have ever tried .####['food quality']
will never be back .####['restaurant general']
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .####['food quality']
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly .####['restaurant general']
the all - u - can - eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .####['food quality']
wont come back again for sure !####['restaurant general']

they forgot a sandwich , did n ' t include plastic forks , and did n ' t include pita with the hummus platter .####['service general']
also , the sandwiches ( nearing $ 7 ) did n ' t come with anything like chips or a side .####['food prices', 'food style options']
overall , not worth the money .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it ' s a very disappointing experience .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']

the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great .####['food quality']
the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .####['service general', 'ambience general']
the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .####['restaurant prices']
even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .####['food quality', 'restaurant prices']
the lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .####['food quality', 'food prices']
we were very pleasantly surprised .####['restaurant general']
the food was delicious ( i had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top - notch .####['service general', 'food quality']
when my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .####['service general']
truly the mark of an attentive waiter .####['service general']
i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .####['restaurant general']
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .####['food quality']
we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods .####['food quality']
they do n ' t concern much of customer ' s health , just want to make money .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
please do n ' t fool us .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
i recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .####['food quality']

the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .####['service general']
the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .####['service general']
after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from . . . maybe you dont know how things work in america . . . and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .####['service general']
we did tip , i guess the model / waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager .####['service general']
pizza here is consistently good .####['food quality']

it is thick and slightly soggy .####['food quality']

the ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .####['food quality', 'restaurant prices', 'ambience general']
i was n ' t thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but i guess that ' s the price you pay for a popular place .####['service general']
i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine !####['food quality']
i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .####['service general']
a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .####['service general']
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .####['service general']
never again !####['restaurant general']
i absolutely loved this place .####['restaurant general']
excellent atmosphere , delicious dishes good and friendly service .####['service general', 'food quality', 'ambience general']

i would recommend roxy ' s for that , but not for their food .####['food quality']
my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !####['food style options']
but , they were too big for the bun .####['food style options']
consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ' nt feel like finishing them .####['food style options']
also they were $ 15 each !####['food prices']
i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .####['food style options']
it was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami - but it did n ' t have much taste - i ' ve had better for less elsewhere !####['food quality', 'food prices']
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .####['food quality']

i ' ve waited over one hour for food .####['service general']
they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .####['service general']
a thai restaurant out of rice during dinner ?####['restaurant miscellaneous']
the food arrived 20 minutes after i called , cold and soggy .####['service general', 'food quality']
this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']

the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .####['service general', 'food quality']
immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .####['service general']
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary !####['service general']
for the people who want great food plus great service , roxy is a place to avoid !####['service general', 'food quality']
the first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .####['food quality']

mizu is the japenese find in grammercy .####['restaurant general']

warning : you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu !####['restaurant general']

the worst excuse for japanese food i ' ve ever encountered .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .####['food quality']
the sushi was awful !####['food quality']
the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .####['food quality']
furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .####['food quality']

it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine .####['food quality']

the wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she ' s - way - cuter - than - me - that - b @ # $ * way ) .####['service general']
the food is yummy , especially their cooked - to - perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .####['food quality']
but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the bts .####['ambience general']

this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .####['service general']
the only thing you can do here is walk in and eat . . but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it .####['restaurant miscellaneous']

the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .####['drinks style options', 'food prices']

my husband and i have been sold on this from the first visit .####['restaurant general']
the wait staff is very courteous and accomodating .####['service general']

there are no negatives to speak of .####['restaurant general']

im not necessarily fanatical about this place , but it was a fun time for low pirces .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
lobster was good , nothing spectacular .####['food quality']

i ordered the vitello alla marsala and i was pretty impressed .####['food quality']
the veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly .####['food quality']
the potato balls were not dry at all . . . in fact it was buttery .####['food quality']
the only downside . . . they only take cash which is ok if you know about it ahead of time .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
i ' ll be back for sure .####['restaurant general']
worst place on smith street in brooklyn####['restaurant general']
very immature bartender , didnt know how to make specific drinks , service was so slowwwww , the food was not fresh or warm , waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers .####['service general', 'food quality']
i would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'restaurant general']
awesome####['restaurant general']
the food is always fresh . . .####['food quality']
overpriced japanese food with mediocre service####['service general', 'food prices']
went here on sat 1 / 26 and was disappointed .####['restaurant general']
food was luke warm .####['food quality']
i was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have .####['food style options']
not because you are ` ` the four seasons ` ` . . . – you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner .####['restaurant prices']
the food was excellent as well as service , however , i left the four seasons very dissappointed .####['service general', 'food quality', 'restaurant general']
i do not think dinner in manhattan should cost $ 400 . 00 where i am not swept off my feet .####['food prices']
red dragon roll - my favorite thing to eat , of any food group - hands down####['food quality']
if you do n ' t like it , i do n ' t know what to tell you .####['food quality']
the seafood dynamite is also otherworldly .####['food quality']
i ' m not even going to bother to describe it ; it speaks for itself .####['food quality']
an unpretentious spot in park slope , the sushi is consistently good , the service is pleasant , effective and unassuming .####['service general', 'food quality', 'ambience general']
in the summer months , the back garden area is really nice .####['ambience general']
the dancing , white river and millenium rolls are musts .####['food quality']

great indian food !####['food quality']

watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that ' s more lemony than smoky .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
oh , and there ' s hookah .####['ambience general']
raymond the bartender rocks !####['service general']
pacifico is a great place to casually hang out .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
the drinks are great , especially when made by raymond .####['service general', 'drinks quality']
the omlette for brunch is great . . .####['food quality']
quacamole at pacifico is yummy , as are the wings with chimmichuri .####['food quality']
a weakness is the chicken in the salads .####['food quality']
it ' s just average , just shredded , no seasoning on it .####['food quality']
also , i personally was n ' t a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole .####['food quality']
overall , decent food at a good price , with friendly people .####['service general', 'food quality']
best indian restaurant in the city####['restaurant general']
this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york .####['food quality']
what really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices , and all made in - house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .####['food quality']
all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come - - if you do n ' t eat one your trip was wasted .####['food quality']
best restaurant in brooklyn####['restaurant general']
the best !####['restaurant general']
great food , amazing service , this place is a class act .####['service general', 'food quality', 'restaurant general']

delicious , creative and fun .####['food quality', 'food style options']
got a date ? go here !####['restaurant general']
every time i have a special occasion with my boyfriend i have a hard time going anywhere else .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
it is so romantic .####['ambience general']
its dark , and cozy . . there is always jazz music playing when we go .####['ambience general']
most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like ' that ' couple .####['ambience general']
the food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together .####['food style options']
i ' ve enjoyed 99 % of the dishes we ' ve ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too - authentic - for - me dish ( i ' m a daring eater but not that daring ) .####['food quality']
once you try it for a special occasion beware . . you ca n ' t stop !####['restaurant miscellaneous']
you ' ll be there for every anniversary , birthday , valentines day . . .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
for a fabulous wedding !####['restaurant miscellaneous']
everyone raved about the atmosphere ( elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views ) and the fabulous food !####['food quality', 'ambience general', 'location general']
service was wonderful ;####['service general']
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .####['service general']
paul , the maitre d ' , was totally professional and always on top of things .####['service general']
thank you everyone at water ' s edge .####['restaurant general']
would not go back .####['restaurant general']
service ok but unfriendly , filthy bathroom .####['service general', 'ambience general']
the bar drinks were eh , ok to say the least .####['drinks quality']
the stuff tilapia was horrid . . . tasted like cardboard .####['food quality']
we thought the dessert would be better , wrong !####['food quality']
$ 170 down the toilet . . .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting .####['ambience general']
the floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .####['ambience general']
good experience####['restaurant general']
the wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings .####['service general', 'drinks style options']
the bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the ` ` free ' ' appetizer of olives was disappointing .####['food quality']
however , our main course was wonderful .####['food quality']
i had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations .####['food quality']
the dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .####['service general', 'food quality']
when we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .####['service general']
all in all , i would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .####['service general', 'ambience general', 'restaurant general']
short and sweet – seating is great : it ' s romantic , cozy and private .####['ambience general']
the boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they ' re perfect for 2 people .####['ambience general']
the service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .####['service general']
over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food .####['food quality', 'restaurant prices', 'ambience general']
will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try at least once .####['restaurant general']
noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food i enjoy .####['service general', 'food quality']
servers are all different , greg is my favorite .####['service general']
sometimes tables do n ' t understand his sense of humor but it ' s refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner .####['service general']
this is the first place i ' ve been that a runner remembers my order . . . hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant .####['service general']
prices are fair across the board for both food and bev .####['drinks prices', 'food prices']
i go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .####['service general']
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings ! ! !####['food quality', 'food style options']
this place had all the trimmings and i mean all .####['food style options']
peppers , onions , relish , chilli , cheeses , you name it .####['food style options']
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place out ! ! ! !####['food quality', 'restaurant general']
best dining experience in the west village !####['restaurant general']
stepping into casa la femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in new york !####['restaurant general']
highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night i had !####['service general', 'food quality', 'ambience general', 'restaurant general']
the have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for !####['drinks quality']
we were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .####['ambience general']
i never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !####['restaurant general']
maggot in the food !####['food quality']
the menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .####['service general', 'food quality', 'food style options']
nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that ' s when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .####['food quality']
i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .####['service general']
the manager finally said he would com # # p the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .####['service general']
we paid and left because we did n ' t feel like arguing any more .####['service general']
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .####['food quality']
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .####['service general', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
unhygienic####['food quality']
i do not recommend .####['restaurant general']
i got hair in my food 2 times of then !####['food quality']
great place , great value .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
the food is flavorful , plentiful and reasonably priced .####['food quality', 'food prices', 'food style options']
the atmosphere is relaxed and casual .####['ambience general']
it ' s a great place to order from or sit - in .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
awesome####['restaurant general']
inexpensive , unassuming , great time !####['restaurant prices', 'ambience general', 'restaurant general']
sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance .####['food quality']
try it !####['restaurant general']
very pleased####['restaurant general']
good creative rolls !####['food quality', 'food style options']
yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi , or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
they have great rolls , the triple color and norwegetan rolls , are awesome and filling .####['food quality', 'food style options']
one special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !####['food quality', 'food style options']
they have a delicious banana chocolate dessert , as well as a great green tea tempura .####['food quality']
the appetizers are also delicious !####['food quality']
mazing interior .####['ambience general']
great food !####['food quality']
i ' ve had my fair share of modern japanese and this spot delivers .####['food quality']
the atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .####['ambience general']
if you ' re into being lost when you ' re just five feet from your table then hey , that ' s a good thing .####['ambience general']
despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go - to for modern japanese food for the foreseeable future .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
indo chinese food , pretty good . . .####['food quality']
not a very fancy place but very good chinese style indian food .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
the chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( i have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the chilli chicken .####['food quality']
my mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she ( being indian ) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .####['food quality']
still we keep going back : )####['restaurant general']
i was speechless by the horrible food .####['food quality']
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .####['food quality']
i was so stunned , and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .####['restaurant general']
this place survives on reputation alone .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
i will never return .####['restaurant general']
best in all of nyc####['restaurant general']
this is the most wonderful restaurant in all of new york city , not just brooklyn . . .####['restaurant general']
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty , most delicious food and kept it that way . . .####['food quality']
never swaying , never a bad meal , never bad service . . .####['service general', 'food quality', 'restaurant general']
you should travel from the bronx to try it . . .####['restaurant general']
great food , great wine list , great service in a great neighborhood . . .####['service general', 'food quality', 'drinks style options', 'location general']
so delicious ! ! ! ! ! !####['food quality']
patsy ' s pizza = true love####['restaurant general']
hands down the best pizza on the planet .####['food quality']
in about 12 minutes , the thing is gone .####['food quality']
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .####['food quality']
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !####['food quality', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
great taste####['food quality']
great , original taste .####['food quality']
for me dishes a little oily , but overall dining experience good .####['food quality', 'restaurant general']
helpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .####['service general', 'food prices']
great food####['food quality']
this place has great indian chinese food .####['food quality']
the flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal .####['food quality', 'food prices']
be prepared to wait , because the place is pretty tiny .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'ambience general']
also , they do not take credit card so come with cash !####['restaurant miscellaneous']
even though the place is not beautiful , the food speaks for itself .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
best indian chinese in the city , by far !####['food quality']
amazing my favorite ! ! !####['restaurant general']
i came across village underground by accident , now i go there all the time .####['restaurant general']
the service is amazing , i ' ve had different waiters and they were all nice , which is a rare thing in nyc .####['service general']
the dj is awesome , i have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and i keep going back .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
you can get a table without a reservation if you get there early i they do n ' t make you by bottles .####['service general']
which lets face it . . . . at times it ' s a good thing .####['service general']
in the end you end up with a fair tab and nothing but a great time ! ! !####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
highly recommended !####['restaurant general']
one of the best , if not the best , restaurants in park slope ( and ny in general )####['restaurant general']
everything on the menu is great .####['food quality']
this establishment is the real deal .####['restaurant general']
wish ny had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .####['food quality', 'ambience general', 'restaurant general']
but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n ' t include wine ?####['food prices']
look , the appetizers were really good .####['food quality']
the entree was also very good .####['food quality']
ca n ' t argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .####['food prices']
what you are paying for is the environment and the name .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'ambience general']
yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .####['ambience general']
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef .####['food quality']
surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
vanison was good but not amazing .####['food quality']
bison was quite excellent however .####['food quality']
dessert : pure disaster .####['food quality']
just not good at all .####['food quality']
some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all .####['food quality', 'food style options']
i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say ` ` i ' ve been to the four seasons restaurant ' ' .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
all in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) .####['food quality']
if you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .####['food quality']
you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .####['service general']
service was just ok , it is not what you ' d expect for $ 500 .####['service general', 'restaurant prices']
terrible waste of money . . scammers####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience !####['restaurant general']
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table .####['service general']
although we were told 10 - 15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .####['service general']
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .####['restaurant general']
the place is beautiful !####['ambience general']
the hostess was very pleasant .####['service general']
our experience did not ever get any better .####['restaurant general']
for each course we waited over 1 / 2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .####['service general']
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka .####['service general']
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .####['service general']
we asked for beverages and never received them .####['service general']
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .####['service general']
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .####['food quality']
i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .####['food quality', 'food prices']
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka !####['service general']
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !####['service general']
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !####['service general']
to top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .####['service general', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
by the time we left our wallets were empty and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !####['food quality', 'restaurant prices']
i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .####['restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended . . . and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly !####['service general', 'restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
i wish i could be refunded !####['restaurant general']
do n ' t go with a larger group than 4 !####['restaurant miscellaneous']
at first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .####['service general']
the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .####['food style options']
there was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .####['drinks style options']
not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with brahma .####['drinks style options']
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .####['service general', 'food quality', 'food style options']
the lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .####['food style options']
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the ` ` salt encrusted shrimp ' ' appetizer .####['food style options']
she replied ` ` well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . ' '####['service general']
the food arrived in about 15 minutes .####['service general']
i had the thai style fried sea bass . . . which was very good .####['food quality']
everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice !####['food quality', 'food style options']
i heard the lobster roll was excellent .####['food quality']
they seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her fork in hand ) .####['service general']
all in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh .####['food quality', 'food prices']
service not the friendliest to our ` ` large party ' ' !####['service general']
probably would not go back here .####['restaurant general']
great indian food####['food quality']
food was amazing - i love indian food and eat it quite regularly , but i can say this is one of the best i ' ve had .####['food quality']
very ` ` normal indian food ' ' , but done really well .####['food quality', 'food style options']
also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .####['service general']
but if you ' re prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for indian food####['food quality', 'restaurant prices']
one of the best####['restaurant general']
bukhara grill , the tagline says it all . . ` ` indian spice rave ' '####['restaurant general']
the lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .####['food prices']
we have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given .####['service general', 'food quality']
bukhara is on my top 5 indian places in nyc####['restaurant general']
wretched and retching####['restaurant general']
i have never been so disgusted by both food an service .####['service general', 'food quality']
for starters they delivered us someone else ' s order .####['service general']
however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it ' s your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####['food quality']
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .####['service general', 'food quality']
none was made so i hung up .####['service general']
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet .####['food quality']
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####['service general', 'food quality']
it was n ' t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it ' s simply repulsive .####['restaurant general']
gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'ambience general']
i book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
i completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
more williamsburg garbage####['restaurant general']
the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart .####['service general']
the bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n ' t even close to sizzling .####['food quality']
too bad i had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .####['food prices']
the nakgi - bokum was horrible .####['food quality']
easily the worst stir - fried squid i ' ve ever tasted .####['food quality']
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean .####['food quality']
the side dishes were passable , and i did get a refill upon request .####['food quality']
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service .####['service general']
she just nodded and walked off .####['service general']
as to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made .####['service general']
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .####['food quality']
we were charged full price .####['service general']
lives up to the hype####['restaurant general']
we ' ve tried before but it always packed and does n ' t take reservations .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
it was well worth the wait .####['restaurant general']
the wife had the risotto which was amazing .####['food quality']
it does n ' t look appetizing as it ' s covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .####['food quality', 'food style options']
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .####['food quality']
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza####['food quality', 'restaurant general']
love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go .####['restaurant general']
a quintessential slice of nyc pizza .####['food quality']
the crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####['food quality']
personally i like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .####['food quality']
possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city####['ambience general']
this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie ( that don ’ t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate decor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city .####['ambience general', 'location general']
if you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .####['ambience general']
it ’ s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘ excuse me ’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth !####['service general', 'ambience general']
my party had the bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !####['food prices', 'food style options']
we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .####['food quality']
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .####['food quality']
the entrees were served with miso soup and rice .####['food style options']
for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .####['food quality']
i do n ' t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i ' ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
terrible would be a compliment !####['restaurant general']
the service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .####['service general']
we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing ! !####['service general']
we never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .####['service general']
they are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !####['service general', 'drinks prices', 'food prices']
stay away####['restaurant general']
great shabu shabu####['food quality']
i love it .####['restaurant general']
but for the shabu shabu , you wo n ' t find much better in ny .####['food quality']
the meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .####['service general', 'food quality', 'food prices', 'food style options']
dokebi gives williamsburg the right one - two punch of classic korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .####['food quality']
the hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .####['food quality']
restaurant with a view####['location general']
the food tasted very good .####['food quality']
the main entree was also very good .####['food quality']
price is high but the food is good , so i would come back again .####['restaurant general', 'food quality', 'food prices']
this place does n ' t make any sense####['restaurant general']
just want to warn you all - do n ' t waste your time and money .####['restaurant general']
this place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional . . .####['ambience general']
this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
the concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n ' t work .####['food style options']
good food####['food quality']
the food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , i do n ' t like being cramp in a corner .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
over all it was a very nice romantic place .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
loved it####['restaurant general']
a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it .####['restaurant general']
the atmosphere was great .####['ambience general']
the food we ordered was excellent , although i would n ' t say the margaritas were anything to write home about .####['food quality', 'drinks quality']
our waitress was n ' t mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####['service general']
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####['restaurant general']
regardless , we ' ll be back and ca n ' t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
dumbfoundingly poor####['restaurant general']
this was , from start to finish , a mind - bogglingly uncomfortable experience .####['restaurant general']
lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn .####['service general']
the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .####['service general']
polite acknowledgement is out ;####['service general']
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?####['service general']
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####['service general', 'food quality']
overall the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n ' t sat cooling in front of the guest .####['service general', 'food quality']
the place has a nice fit - out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins )####['service general', 'drinks style options', 'ambience general']
at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you ' re looking to pay by the hour for passive - aggressive torture .####['service general', 'restaurant prices', 'restaurant general']
on that scale , it ' s a world - beater .####['restaurant general']
how is this palce still open ?####['restaurant general']
i honestly do n ' t even know where to begin .####['restaurant general']
we arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .####['service general']
everything was going good until we got our meals .####['food quality', 'restaurant general']
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .####['food style options']
it was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .####['food quality', 'food style options']
i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms .####['food quality', 'food prices']
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n ' t say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .####['service general']
so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it .####['food quality']
i could n ' t even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .####['food style options']
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .####['food quality']
guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , ` ` oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier ' ' no apology , nothing .####['service general']
after that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !####['service general']
no desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !####['service general']
this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it ' s a matter of taste that she did n ' t like it , and i can not comp it .####['service general']
again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !####['service general']
the level of rudeness was preposterous .####['service general']
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .####['service general', 'food quality', 'drinks quality']
i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience .####['restaurant general']
this staff should be fired .####['service general']
cirspy crust margherita pizza####['food quality']
it was really good pizza .####['food quality']
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded : ) : ) : )####['food quality', 'food style options']
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review .####['restaurant general']
i ' ll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this place .####['restaurant general']
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
well . . . they can run but they ca n ' t hide .####['restaurant general']
this place . . . god where do i begin .####['restaurant general']
the decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n ' t notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 frickin hours to come ! ! ! !####['service general', 'food quality', 'ambience general', 'food prices']
great hot dogs !####['food quality']
the hot dogs are top notch , and they ' re slamwich is amazing !####['food quality']
going to bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !####['food quality', 'restaurant general']
only complaint is the pricing - - i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .####['food prices']
fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n ' t put you off –####['service general', 'food quality']
it ' s a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we ' ve eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .####['restaurant prices']
each time we ' ve been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they ' re fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .####['service general', 'food quality']
as bfc does n ' t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####['service general', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
the frizzy retro girl ( with winged / dame edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .####['service general']
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she ` ` had a bbq to go to ' ' that night - wtf ? ?####['service general']
i ' d be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !####['service general']
there ' s another girl who i ca n ' t describe , she is about 5 ' 6 ' ' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you ' re * really * talking about .####['service general']
i ' m a friendly person , so i would n ' t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .####['service general']
again , i ' d be super upset if that were my employee .####['service general']
considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service .####['service general', 'restaurant prices']
so , if you ' re walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who ' s going to be seating you first . . .####['service general']
maitre - d - ' ' eat and get out ' '####['service general']
while finishing our meals which included a high - end bottle of wine , our son ' s fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .####['drinks quality']
this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .####['service general']
his response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .####['service general']
if you go here , do it on his off - night .####['service general']
best meal in a long time !####['food quality']
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening .####['food quality']
my father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish .####['food quality']
the four seasons restaurant is a great experience .####['restaurant general']
the food is great and the environment is even better .####['food quality', 'ambience general']
everyone must come here at least once .####['restaurant general']
highly recommend it !####['restaurant general']
taking hot dogs to the next level####['food quality']
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at bark you do n ' t just get your average hot dog .####['food quality', 'restaurant prices']
here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .####['food quality', 'food style options']
great atmosphere####['ambience general']
i highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .####['food quality']
cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .####['ambience general']
poor service and management####['service general']
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner .####['restaurant general']
appetizers took nearly an hour .####['service general']
never got an explanation as to what was going on .####['service general']
the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .####['service general']
on the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .####['service general']
can ’ t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .####['service general', 'restaurant prices']
what a hassle !####['restaurant general']
the food is very good , but not outstanding .####['food quality']
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .####['service general', 'food quality']
on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .####['service general']
mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine . . . but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff .####['service general']
expensive####['restaurant prices']
the pasta was well cooked , did n ' t have enough sauce though or flavor .####['food quality']
so rude ! ! !####['service general']
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .####['restaurant general']
the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .####['service general']
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .####['service general']
i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane .####['service general']
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , ` ` can i help you ' ' and ` ` how many are in your party . ' '####['service general']
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .####['service general']
we did n ' t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
bad staff####['service general']
i generally like this place .####['restaurant general']
the design of the space is good .####['ambience general']
but the service is horrid !####['service general']
i was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .####['service general']
the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .####['service general']
i ca n ' t believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !####['service general']
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .####['service general']
i could n ' t ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .####['service general']
she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .####['service general']
i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would retrain the staff .####['service general', 'restaurant general']
