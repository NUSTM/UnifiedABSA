Watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that 's more lemony than smoky .####['food quality', 'ambience general']

The hot dogs are top notch , and they 're Slamwich is amazing !####['food quality']

Inexpensive , unassuming , great time !####['ambience general', 'restaurant general', 'restaurant prices']
Only complaint is the pricing -- I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .####['food prices']
Everything on the menu is great .####['food quality']
The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####['food quality']

The floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .####['ambience general']

Yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi , or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
The staff is very good .####['service general']
When the main course finally arrived ( another 45mins ) half of our order was missing .####['service general']
Sometimes tables do n't understand his sense of humor but it 's refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner .####['service general']

It 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .####['restaurant prices']
I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .####['service general']
The chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( I have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the Chilli Chicken .####['food quality']

Servers are all different , Greg is my favorite .####['service general']
Paul , the maitre, was totally professional and always on top of things .####['service general']
They honored reservation on Sunday afternoon very well .####['service general']
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .####['service general']
The food is very good , but not outstanding .####['food quality']
MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm so delicious####['food quality']
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .####['service general', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I 've ever tasted .####['food quality']
It doesn 't look appetizing as it 's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .####['food quality', 'food style_options']
I highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .####['food quality']
It was totally overpriced - fish and chips was about $ 15 ...####['food prices']
I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass ... which was very good .####['food quality']

This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that don ’ t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the `` free `` appetizer of olives was disappointing .####['food quality', 'food prices']
I showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .####['service general']
I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .####['restaurant general', 'restaurant prices']
I will NEVER return .####['restaurant general']
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####['restaurant general']
Unhygienic####['food quality']
Best In ALL of NYC####['restaurant general']
Excellent food for great prices####['food quality', 'food prices']
$ 170 down the toilet ...####['restaurant prices']

Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location .####['restaurant miscellaneous', 'restaurant prices']
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food .####['food quality', 'food style_options']

The food here was mediocre at best .####['food quality']
The food was excellent as well as service , however , I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed .####['food quality', 'service general', 'restaurant general']
We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table .####['service general']
This place doesn 't make any sense####['restaurant general']
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !####['food quality', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'restaurant prices']
I heard the lobster roll was excellent .####['food quality']

Great Atmosphere####['ambience general']
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n't work .####['food style_options']
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty , most delicious food and kept it that way ...####['food quality']
We didn 't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem .####['restaurant miscellaneous']
Helpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .####['service general', 'food prices']
Terrible Waste of money . . scammers####['restaurant general', 'restaurant prices']
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .####['service general']
One of my favorite places in Brooklyn .####['restaurant general']
His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .####['service general']
We arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .####['service general']
The drinks are great , especially when made by Raymond .####['drinks quality', 'service general']
Lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn .####['service general']
The pastas are incredible , the risottos ( particularly the sepia ) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing .####['food quality']
When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I didn 't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .####['service general']
The sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious .####['food quality', 'food style_options']
We were charged full price .####['service general']
When we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing .####['service general']
Will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once .####['restaurant general']
To top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .####['service general']
Nevertheless , I finished my plate , and that 's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .####['food quality']
The nakgi-bokum was horrible .####['food quality']

The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they 're perfect for 2 people .####['ambience general']
Awesome####['restaurant general']
this place had ALL the trimmings and i mean all .####['food style_options']
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn 't have an upscale feel .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general', 'food prices']
short and sweet – seating is great : it 's romantic , cozy and private .####['ambience general']

Once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !####['service general']

Patsy 's Pizza - true love####['restaurant general']
What really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .####['food quality']
Great Indian Food !####['food quality']
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .####['food quality', 'service general', 'food style_options']
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .####['food quality']
Prices are fair across the board for both food and bev .####['drinks prices', 'food prices']
One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !####['food quality', 'food style_options']

My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####['food quality', 'service general']
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .####['restaurant miscellaneous']

Over all it was a very nice romantic place .####['ambience general', 'restaurant general']
The food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together .####['food style_options']
When we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .####['service general']

The only thing that strikes you is the decor ? ( not very pleasant ) .####['ambience general']
On that scale , it 's a world-beater .####['restaurant general']
The service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .####['service general']
At first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .####['service general']
The food is flavorful , plentiful and reasonably priced .####['food quality', 'food style_options', 'food prices']
I would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .####['food quality', 'food prices']
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####['food quality', 'service general']
Yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .####['ambience general', 'restaurant prices']
It 's a great place to order from or sit-in .####['restaurant miscellaneous']

However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####['food quality']

If you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .####['ambience general']
