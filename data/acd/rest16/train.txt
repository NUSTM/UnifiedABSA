Good drink .####['drinks quality']
The service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .####['service general']
It is also extremely well priced .####['food prices']
They were such a rip-off ( $ 8 .95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying .####['food quality', 'food style_options', 'food prices']
The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####['food quality']
but when we looked at the menu , there weren 't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .####['food style_options']

The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative .####['ambience general', 'service general', 'restaurant miscellaneous']
This place blew me away ... by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side .####['restaurant general']
