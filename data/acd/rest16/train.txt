Good drink .####['drinks quality']
The service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .####['service general']
It is also extremely well priced .####['food prices']
They were such a rip-off ( $ 8 .95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying .####['food quality', 'food style_options', 'food prices']
The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####['food quality']

This place blew me away ... by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side .####['restaurant general']
