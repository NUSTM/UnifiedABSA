reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .####[['NULL', 'laptop', 'negative', 'terrible'], ['touch screen', 'display', 'negative', 'NULL']]

it is solid , and does a decent job rendering pages , and paired with the extra ram here , it adequately handles streaming content in the background - such as youtube or spotify - and still maintains a decent browsing experience across eight to ten additional tabs ;####[['NULL', 'laptop', 'positive', 'solid'], ['NULL', 'laptop', 'positive', 'decent'], ['NULL', 'laptop', 'positive', 'NULL']]
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####[['acer chromebook 14', 'laptop', 'positive', 'excellent']]
i led with those first five points for a reason : being able to purchase a decently - performing chromebook with aluminum build , a 1080p ips display , 4gb of ram , 32gb of local storage , and an intel quad - core processor for $ 299 is basically what the entirely of the chromeos subreddit has been asking for over the past few years .####[['NULL', 'laptop', 'positive', 'decently']]
5 years old or matched by chromebooks at half the price , the absence of a touchscreen upgrade , or the use of slower emmc storage instead of a real m .####[['emmc storage', 'memory', 'negative', 'slower']]
these are all valid points that probably make this more of a 4 .####[['NULL', 'laptop', 'positive', 'NULL']]
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .####[['acer', 'company', 'positive', 'NULL']]
