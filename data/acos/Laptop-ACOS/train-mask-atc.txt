thanks to its ssd , it boots <extra_id_0> pretty fast , bloatware is kept to a minimum ( please uninstall norton before doing anything else .####<extra_id_0> os operation performance <extra_id_1>

it is also amazingly quiet : the <extra_id_0> doesn ' t make any noise , and the fan only spins up if i am doing something intensive like playing games or running a heafty program - just browsing or watching videos / basic office work will not make this computer more than whisper .####<extra_id_0> hardware operation performance <extra_id_1>

anyways , i am a bit sad that the <extra_id_0> is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the <extra_id_0> will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the <extra_id_0> , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####<extra_id_0> hard disc design features <extra_id_1> hard disc design features <extra_id_2>

pros : nice size , clear <extra_id_0> , quick on start up , very functional and easy to use .####<extra_id_0> display general <extra_id_1>
the <extra_id_0> is a nice size and the pads clicks on touch and not stiff or hard .####<extra_id_0> keyboard design features <extra_id_1>
the <extra_id_0> sucks as it starts to die after 3 - 4 hours of use ( no gaming ) .####<extra_id_0> battery operation performance <extra_id_1>
lastly , the <extra_id_0> , even after lowering the sensitivity , it ' s still pretty sensitive and the click pads are stiff , so it doesn ' t tap on clicks , sometimes i have to click on it hard enough , so that ' s a bit annoying .####<extra_id_0> keyboard operation performance <extra_id_1>

only con would be that <extra_id_0> is not that bright , although i would say at the brightest setting is probably where it should be .####<extra_id_0> display operation performance <extra_id_1>
also <extra_id_0> is pretty decent .####<extra_id_0> multimedia devices general <extra_id_1>

the <extra_id_0> are currently stuck .####<extra_id_0> display operation performance <extra_id_1>
i will see if <extra_id_0> honors their warrnty , if so , i will probably change / update this review .####<extra_id_0> company general <extra_id_1>
the <extra_id_0> is an amazing product with one huge glaring flaw - you can not use the <extra_id_1> with any android apps , nor use android apps with wifi tethering or anything reaching ` ` outside the sandbox ` ` .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1> ports operation performance <extra_id_2>
oops , i didn ' t anticipate <extra_id_0> is crippled on here .####<extra_id_0> software operation performance <extra_id_1>
if you are wanting a beautiful <extra_id_0> that beats all other tablets for color range and matches samsung ' s galaxy tab s3 ( top android tablet ) , but if you absolutely must have a <extra_id_1> , don ' t buy this .####<extra_id_0> display design features <extra_id_1> keyboard general <extra_id_2>
i am terribly disappointed with obviously a poor <extra_id_0> by samsung .####<extra_id_0> company quality <extra_id_1> company quality <extra_id_2>
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , <extra_id_0> started flickering all over the place .####<extra_id_0> display operation performance <extra_id_1>
returning it into a standard laptop position did not help , the <extra_id_0> actually turned dark and only closing and opening the lid helped return it to normal state .####<extra_id_0> display operation performance <extra_id_1>
to make things worse , i currently live overseas and am highly doubtful that <extra_id_0> would do anything about this , given that it was bought in the us .####<extra_id_0> support operation performance <extra_id_1>
no matter where on earth , you can get your <extra_id_0> repaired .####<extra_id_0> support general <extra_id_1>
in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this <extra_id_0> given the obvious history of quality control issues .####<extra_id_0> laptop quality <extra_id_1>
wanting something maybe a pinch faster , but more importantly , a flippy <extra_id_0> with google play support .####<extra_id_0> display operation performance <extra_id_1>
first and foremost , lets talk about the infamous <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> keyboard general <extra_id_1>
i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of <extra_id_0> and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .####<extra_id_0> keyboard general <extra_id_1>
i ' ll give the chromebook pro an extra star for its best asset , the <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> display general <extra_id_1>
it ' s also worth noting my unit came with a floating <extra_id_0> , with initial play before the actually click .####<extra_id_0> display operation performance <extra_id_1>
if you are indifferent about the <extra_id_0> , do not buy this !####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>
i just got this <extra_id_0> last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####<extra_id_0> laptop operation performance <extra_id_1>
there is a <extra_id_0> on the side which i have accidentally hit quite a few times .####<extra_id_0> keyboard design features <extra_id_1>
i haven ' t abused this at all , and i noticed a small crack in the <extra_id_0> today and it ' s starting to spider out .####<extra_id_0> display quality <extra_id_1>
so $ 500 bucks down the drain as i ' m sure that isn ' t covered by any <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> warranty quality <extra_id_1>
with it being a <extra_id_0> it surprised me that it cracked and i have no idea how .####<extra_id_0> display operation performance <extra_id_1>
my <extra_id_0> stayed black more than it was on .####<extra_id_0> display operation performance <extra_id_1>
<extra_id_0> needs to fix that issue .####<extra_id_0> company general <extra_id_1>
except , you know , when <extra_id_0> decided to become unusable .####<extra_id_0> laptop operation performance <extra_id_1>
i just wanted to make it known my personal experiences with the <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> laptop operation performance <extra_id_1>
awesome <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> display general <extra_id_1>

<extra_id_0> could be studier and <extra_id_1> and <extra_id_2> very average and lack of <extra_id_3> is a deal breaker for me .####<extra_id_0> hardware general <extra_id_1> keyboard design features <extra_id_2> keyboard design features <extra_id_3> keyboard design features <extra_id_4>
<extra_id_0> is non standard .####<extra_id_0> hardware operation performance <extra_id_1>
i say this <extra_id_0> is worth no more than $ 300 .####<extra_id_0> laptop price <extra_id_1>
it is very limited and the competition for an actual usable <extra_id_0> that can do a lot more than just browse the internet , are available .####<extra_id_0> os operation performance <extra_id_1>
<extra_id_0> is is meh .####<extra_id_0> laptop quality <extra_id_1>
its cheap plastic and honestly , the <extra_id_0> its really bad .####<extra_id_0> keyboard general <extra_id_1>
it simply feels like a cheap <extra_id_0> with a keyboard attached .####<extra_id_0> laptop miscellaneous <extra_id_1>
the <extra_id_0> its immature .####<extra_id_0> software usability <extra_id_1>
their <extra_id_0> are made for phones and on this huge screen , they are palpitated .####<extra_id_0> software design features <extra_id_1>
this is quite honest , a very expensive <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> laptop price <extra_id_1>
i would however spend $ 300 on this <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> laptop price <extra_id_1>
after a couple of weeks i started experiencing <extra_id_0> issues .####<extra_id_0> software operation performance <extra_id_1>
first occasionally and later to a point where the <extra_id_0> became unusable .####<extra_id_0> laptop operation performance <extra_id_1>
after some googling i realized that the <extra_id_0> issue was related to bluetooth being on .####<extra_id_0> ports operation performance <extra_id_1>
<extra_id_0> also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####<extra_id_0> hardware operation performance <extra_id_1> hardware operation performance <extra_id_2>
10 minutes after finishing this review started having a new issue : <extra_id_0> started acting out .####<extra_id_0> hardware operation performance <extra_id_1>
you know , i wanted to love this <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>
i went in to this purchase assuming that the availability of <extra_id_0> from the google play store would make this unit into a true windows alternative .####<extra_id_0> software usability <extra_id_1>
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the <extra_id_0> is indeed appallingly bad .####<extra_id_0> keyboard operation performance <extra_id_1>
' what a bunch of whiners , ' i concluded about all the people who slammed the <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> keyboard general <extra_id_1>
so one star off for the <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> keyboard general <extra_id_1>
none of their <extra_id_0> were what i would call usable .####<extra_id_0> software usability <extra_id_1>
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> display general <extra_id_1>
unfortunately , my <extra_id_0> that i purchased through best buy was dead on arrival .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>
the <extra_id_0> functions just fine .####<extra_id_0> power supply operation performance <extra_id_1>
the <extra_id_0> is simply dead from what i can tell .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>
as you can see , the <extra_id_0> is active , but the ` ` <extra_id_1> ` ` has never had any color .####<extra_id_0> power supply operation performance <extra_id_1> power supply quality <extra_id_2>
very disappointing , <extra_id_0> !####<extra_id_0> company general <extra_id_1>
i really needed this <extra_id_0> for work and had big plans for using it ' s features / versatility .####<extra_id_0> laptop operation performance <extra_id_1>
all i got was a fancy 2lb <extra_id_0> that can only be used to swat flies .####<extra_id_0> laptop operation performance <extra_id_1>
apparently there is some optimizations that <extra_id_0> has done with the op1 and pixel that allow what is called instant ink .####<extra_id_0> company operation performance <extra_id_1>
i have also noticed the <extra_id_0> seems to run hotter and have a noticeably shorter <extra_id_1> .####<extra_id_0> fans&cooling operation performance <extra_id_1> battery operation performance <extra_id_2>
initially the <extra_id_0> lived up to the expectations .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>
there were challenges with the <extra_id_0> and the <extra_id_1> worked sometimes , but most of them had the size issue where they are only the size of a phone screen .####<extra_id_0> software design features <extra_id_1> software design features <extra_id_2>
reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the <extra_id_0> not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .####<extra_id_0> display operation performance <extra_id_1>
also the <extra_id_0> design is sort of rounded at both sides - a minor issue but it makes the device pop open in my purse and detracts from the ` ` feel ` ` of the device by making it feel a lot thicker than it actually is .####<extra_id_0> hardware design features <extra_id_1>
horrible , purchased directly from google , dead <extra_id_0> on arrival , note feature did not pick up <extra_id_1> and <extra_id_2> rarely worked .####<extra_id_0> display quality <extra_id_1> hardware general <extra_id_2> ports operation performance <extra_id_3>
sent it in , arrived back in an inadequate box ( i shipped it in the oroginal with protective foam came back in the box from samsung w / o any protection ) and 3 days after i recieved the item back the <extra_id_0> fell apart .####<extra_id_0> hardware quality <extra_id_1>
<extra_id_0> told me that i ' d have to buy a new one , item is still under warranty .####<extra_id_0> support general <extra_id_1>
i picked up the <extra_id_0> and it fell apart , no drops no damage .####<extra_id_0> hardware quality <extra_id_1>
<extra_id_0> makes garbage and treats their customers with no respect .####<extra_id_0> company general <extra_id_1>
never again will i buy <extra_id_0> and thats what i ' d suggest here .####<extra_id_0> company general <extra_id_1>
no caps lock on the <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> keyboard design features <extra_id_1>
virtually every single <extra_id_0> for it is compromised in some manner .####<extra_id_0> software operation performance <extra_id_1>
<extra_id_0> have to close and be reopened to get them to a somewhat decent size .####<extra_id_0> software usability <extra_id_1>
<extra_id_0> is not matured in any way .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> os usability <extra_id_1>
<extra_id_0> is very concerned about arc to chromeos connections for security , etc etc .####<extra_id_0> company general <extra_id_1>
the rub is that <extra_id_0> itself is so limited in functionality that it is probably the most secure os platform out there .####<extra_id_0> os general <extra_id_1>
<extra_id_0> are glitchy .####<extra_id_0> software usability <extra_id_1>
samsung sent me a new <extra_id_0> free of charge and free of hassle , which was nice of them because the top of the oem <extra_id_0> popped off one day and could not be reassembled .####<extra_id_0> hardware general <extra_id_1> hardware general <extra_id_2>
certain <extra_id_0> ( especially flash based <extra_id_0> ) will get the machine very hot .####<extra_id_0> software operation performance <extra_id_1>
the bottom <extra_id_0> - this is not a unibody machine - will be too hot to rest on bare skin .####<extra_id_0> hardware design features <extra_id_1>
i can not explain why , except to think that there is something wrong with the <extra_id_0> wiring and the left channel is exceeding design capacity .####<extra_id_0> ports operation performance <extra_id_1>
the left <extra_id_0> does not always make full contact with the charger and so sometimes the <extra_id_1> charger is plugged in and slightly awry and therefore not charging .####<extra_id_0> ports operation performance <extra_id_1> ports operation performance <extra_id_2>
the <extra_id_0> doesn ' t have clickable function in the top right or top left corners which is becomes annoying for certain tasks .####<extra_id_0> hardware design features <extra_id_1>
many of acer ' s chromebooks have , historically , been hampered by their poor <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> display general <extra_id_1>

it feels wonderful to finally say that about an <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> display design features <extra_id_1>
a more recent trend among <extra_id_0> is the inclusion of 4gb of ram and 32gb of storage , instead of the 2gb / 16gb to which we ' ve become accustomed .####<extra_id_0> memory operation performance <extra_id_1>
the extra <extra_id_0> , however , is great for everyone , as it makes this device more capable of running many tabs , or handling higher demand tasks like streaming content , without tabs crashing out or caching / reloading .####<extra_id_0> memory operation performance <extra_id_1>
the <extra_id_0> is great , for both media consumption and general computing / web browsing ; it offers a nice amount of local <extra_id_1> and solid performance via the <extra_id_2> and 4gb of ram , and it looks sharp , thanks to modern design queues and aluminum build materials .####<extra_id_0> display general <extra_id_1> memory operation performance <extra_id_2> cpu operation performance <extra_id_3>
the <extra_id_0> is very nice , to be sure , especially considering the price or $ 299 .####<extra_id_0> laptop price <extra_id_1>
it also has pretty decent <extra_id_0> with two usb 3 .####<extra_id_0> ports connectivity <extra_id_1>
i can ' t help but feel that people are also slightly exaggerating the performance offered by the <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> cpu operation performance <extra_id_1>
none of this means the <extra_id_0> is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>
5 years old or matched by chromebooks at half the price , the absence of a touchscreen upgrade , or the use of slower <extra_id_0> instead of a real m .####<extra_id_0> memory operation performance <extra_id_1>

it ' s great in many ways ; the <extra_id_0> is solid , the <extra_id_1> is good ( and the <extra_id_2> is insane ) , and the <extra_id_3> is decent , though only time will tell if it ' s as diet coke - resistant as the samsung ' s keys are .####<extra_id_0> laptop quality <extra_id_1> display general <extra_id_2> display design features <extra_id_3> keyboard design features <extra_id_4>

the feel of the <extra_id_0> is not as smooth ( frictionless ) as others i have used , but it ' s not terrible either .####<extra_id_0> keyboard usability <extra_id_1>

the thing that made me return it was the <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> keyboard general <extra_id_1>
the <extra_id_0> was very glitchy .####<extra_id_0> keyboard general <extra_id_1>
i had the <extra_id_0> speed maxed out and it still was bugging out .####<extra_id_0> keyboard operation performance <extra_id_1>
overall i like the portability and <extra_id_1> on this <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> laptop portability <extra_id_1> battery quality <extra_id_2>
my disappointment begins with the fact that <extra_id_0> is not touch - ready and most websites will not consider touch interface for desktop mode websites .####<extra_id_0> os usability <extra_id_1>
<extra_id_0> like google docs , drive , and gmail don ' t respond well to touch screen gestures often leaving me in despair .####<extra_id_0> software design features <extra_id_1>

• occasionally hangs for 10 - 30 seconds with no response from <extra_id_0> or <extra_id_1>####<extra_id_0> keyboard operation performance <extra_id_1> keyboard operation performance <extra_id_2>
i also decided that despite the advantages of the <extra_id_0> , i can not live with the sharp edges and middling volume .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1> laptop design features <extra_id_2>
at first i was totally stoked on this <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>
aluminum outer body , usb c charging from either side of the chrombooke , backit keyboard , nice screen resolution and fast <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> cpu operation performance <extra_id_1>
then about 3 months in , it quit charging from the supplied <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> power supply operation performance <extra_id_1>
the <extra_id_0> crackling i can live with as i just need to logout and re - log in to fix it for about a week .####<extra_id_0> multimedia devices operation performance <extra_id_1>
the <extra_id_0> issue i can live with as well , even though it is annoying .####<extra_id_0> power supply operation performance <extra_id_1>
the <extra_id_0> is very cool .####<extra_id_0> laptop design features <extra_id_1>
i especially loved the high ( er ) resolution <extra_id_0> , compared to most other chromebooks .####<extra_id_0> display quality <extra_id_1>

<extra_id_0> worked fairly well , and i was pretty pleased with it overall .####<extra_id_0> os operation performance <extra_id_1>
as of the time of writing , the <extra_id_0> are still not working , but i typically don ' t care for that anyways .####<extra_id_0> software operation performance <extra_id_1>
<extra_id_0> did well on this device , but i didn ' t like the scaling it did at higher resolutions .####<extra_id_0> os operation performance <extra_id_1> os operation performance <extra_id_2>
long story short , i loved <extra_id_0> and have been buying them for years .####<extra_id_0> company general <extra_id_1>
i ' m in the us and <extra_id_0> wanted to charge me $ 60 cad for diagnosis only , and then said it would be an additional estimated $ 315 for repair .####<extra_id_0> support operation performance <extra_id_1>
it ' s a real asus hasn ' t been able to improve their <extra_id_0> and won ' t fix this issue .####<extra_id_0> support quality <extra_id_1>
it just is missing a lot of other features that i wanted in a <extra_id_0>####<extra_id_0> laptop design features <extra_id_1>
<extra_id_0> from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####<extra_id_0> software operation performance <extra_id_1>
the <extra_id_0> is easy to use , snappy , and everything the reviewers say .####<extra_id_0> laptop usability <extra_id_1> laptop usability <extra_id_2>
the main bad for this particular variant is that <extra_id_0> is no longer going to support it with updates .####<extra_id_0> support general <extra_id_1>
so be forwarded , if you buy this , you are jumping right into a <extra_id_0> that won ' t get updates anymore ( which is something most chromebook owners want and a feature that makes them better than android and it ' s fragmented market ) .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>
many <extra_id_0> won ' t download and work on it like they do on an ellipsis .####<extra_id_0> software operation performance <extra_id_1>

yay <extra_id_0> they replaced it immediately for me no questions asked .####<extra_id_0> support general <extra_id_1>
the second one arrived , i had it from end of may june , to september started to notice the <extra_id_0> was a bit unresponsive at times .####<extra_id_0> keyboard operation performance <extra_id_1>
in many ways , the <extra_id_0> has lived up to my expectations .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>
it is the nicest <extra_id_0> i have ever owned .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>
it has one serious flaw though which is that the <extra_id_0> can not drive headphones ( or earbuds ) adequately .####<extra_id_0> multimedia devices operation performance <extra_id_1>
even with the volume turned up all the way , the <extra_id_0> is very low which means that you have a poor <extra_id_0>stage .####<extra_id_0> multimedia devices operation performance <extra_id_1>

about half of my <extra_id_0> also do not work .####<extra_id_0> software operation performance <extra_id_1>

this makes it uncomfortable holding it in <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> laptop design features <extra_id_1>
maybe i just got a lemon , but i decided to return this <extra_id_0> after having it for less than two hours .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>
however , for using it as a <extra_id_0> , it seems to only work half the time .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>

everything was good for a few days after receiving the <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>

overall , it is a great <extra_id_0> for the price .####<extra_id_0> laptop price <extra_id_1>
the <extra_id_0> runs super fast and doesn ' t start utilizing its full potential until you start doing things like installation of applications , but the <extra_id_1> usage sits around 40 - 50 % the most of the time .####<extra_id_0> cpu operation performance <extra_id_1> memory operation performance <extra_id_2>
my <extra_id_0> can get it as low as 82 - 83 degrees , consistently , while idle or gaming .####<extra_id_0> fans&cooling operation performance <extra_id_1>

i updated the <extra_id_0> and tested it using razer surround ' s audio drivers ; it still did not fix it .####<extra_id_0> software general <extra_id_1>
do not purchase this <extra_id_0> .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1>
i had previouslu bought an <extra_id_0> which refused to boot unless windows 10 was the os , but i had worked around all of those problems .####<extra_id_0> laptop operation performance <extra_id_1>
i should have known better : <extra_id_0> has boot issues , no way around it .####<extra_id_0> motherboard quality <extra_id_1>

the <extra_id_0> were good , and the overall <extra_id_1> was fine .####<extra_id_0> laptop general <extra_id_1> os operation performance <extra_id_2>
the <extra_id_0> ( for the hybrid drive ) version is old , and causes rare system lockups .####<extra_id_0> software operation performance <extra_id_1>
further , the <extra_id_0> default software on the installation ) caused a blue screen which lead to me having to factory reset .####<extra_id_0> software operation performance <extra_id_1>
msi used to have a <extra_id_0> by disk that would install all the proper drivers in the right order , so you ' d have the perfect configuration .####<extra_id_0> software design features <extra_id_1>
however , the <extra_id_0> has no dvd drive , and no such driver dvd was provided .####<extra_id_0> laptop design features <extra_id_1>
it ' s possible i got bad <extra_id_0> by chance , but all of the issues being directly traceable to <extra_id_1> suggests the issues were all driver - related .####<extra_id_0> hardware quality <extra_id_1> software general <extra_id_2>
second where the heck is my other <extra_id_0> ?####<extra_id_0> memory general <extra_id_1>

the <extra_id_0> is terrible .####<extra_id_0> battery general <extra_id_1>

this <extra_id_0> is fast , as the specs would have you believe , but i ' ve only had it about a week , and it has already crashed so bad once that i had to do a factory reset on it ( though , to be fair , the <extra_id_0> made the reboot super easy , so that was nice ) .####<extra_id_0> laptop operation performance <extra_id_1> laptop quality <extra_id_2> laptop design features <extra_id_3> laptop design features <extra_id_4>
the <extra_id_0> isn ' t super comfortable for casual use ( like on your lap , sitting on a couch ) , so i think it is more meant to be used more or less exclusively for gaming at a desk or table .####<extra_id_0> hardware usability <extra_id_1>
it is heavy , but that is to be expected with a <extra_id_0> like this one .####<extra_id_0> laptop design features <extra_id_1>
, the advertised <extra_id_0> is 16gb and in the answer questions section has answers from the manufacturer saying ` ` this will have 16gb of memory ! ` `####<extra_id_0> memory design features <extra_id_1>

the <extra_id_0> looks fantastic , but i still cant get over the fact that you are basically lied to aboit <extra_id_1> .####<extra_id_0> display design features <extra_id_1> memory general <extra_id_2>
the <extra_id_0> in the faq are wrong , this does not have 16 gb of ram , almost gave it a 1 star bexause of this reason .####<extra_id_0> support general <extra_id_1>
<extra_id_0> is a little wonky if you ' re not deliberate with your fingers , recommend using a mouse .####<extra_id_0> hardware operation performance <extra_id_1>

<extra_id_0> was working fine until just under 3 months of use when it bsod ' d and wouldn ' t turn back on .####<extra_id_0> laptop operation performance <extra_id_1> laptop operation performance <extra_id_2>
looking past the bsod problem , the <extra_id_0> is internal so you can ' t just pop it off , you need access the mobo just to replace it .####<extra_id_0> battery design features <extra_id_1>
this <extra_id_0> is cheap and flimsy , the <extra_id_2> is not removable and the <extra_id_3> is nearly impossible to take off without damaging it .####<extra_id_0> laptop design features <extra_id_1> laptop design features <extra_id_2> battery design features <extra_id_3> laptop design features <extra_id_4>

its a good <extra_id_0> for the price but it needs to work awhile without crashing within 6 months .####<extra_id_0> laptop price <extra_id_1>
the <extra_id_0> is quite sensitive i ' ve noticed , not a big issue to me .####<extra_id_0> hardware operation performance <extra_id_1>

overall i have to remind myself that this <extra_id_0> is only 600 dollars , and with certain gains i ' ll lose some things unless i ' m willing to spend out of budget .####<extra_id_0> laptop price <extra_id_1>

i hate to knock <extra_id_0> as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new <extra_id_1> and then not being able to turn it on to use it .####<extra_id_0> company general <extra_id_1> laptop general <extra_id_2>
