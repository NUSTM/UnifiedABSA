this version has been my least favorite version i ' ve had for the following reasons listed bellow the pros .####[('version', 'laptop', 'negative')]
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####[('track pad', 'hardware', 'negative')]
should not of bought this chromebook .####[('chromebook', 'laptop', 'negative')]
after about 5 / 10 minutes of use the screen goes crazy and you have to force to power down and wait to restart .####[('screen', 'display', 'negative')]
i can not stand the trackpad or the keyboard keys .####[('keyboard keys', 'keyboard', 'negative'), ('trackpad', 'keyboard', 'negative')]

some apps don ' t work but the play store is still in beta right now####[('apps', 'software', 'negative'), ('play store', 'software', 'neutral')]
what really did it was when i tried contacting acer support i was simply told ` ` try a restart ` ` and then ` ` call google , we can ' t help you ` ` .####[('support', 'support', 'negative')]
returning it after one day####[('NULL', 'laptop', 'negative')]
but do not dare will only be good for playing games maybe it will get better .####[('it', 'laptop', 'positive')]

overall this is a good system for the price and i do recommend the ssd for the price .####[('system', 'os', 'positive'), ('ssd', 'hard disc', 'positive')]
but my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises , both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk .####[('fan', 'fans&cooling', 'negative')]
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####[('asus', 'company', 'positive'), ('machines', 'laptop', 'positive')]
if you can save for 750 - 800 i would recommend going up a bit in the asus line .####[('asus', 'company', 'positive')]

it ' s pretty fast for a laptop especially a laptop in this price point .####[('laptop', 'laptop', 'positive'), ('NULL', 'laptop', 'positive')]
i would knock a star for the hard drive size since it ' s incredibly small but at this price you can easily pick up large one to add if you want to and it ' s not like you aren ' t warned when you buy it .####[('hard drive size', 'hard disc', 'positive')]
the picture clarity is amazing and the backlit keyboard is awesome .####[('picture clarity', 'display', 'positive'), ('backlit keyboard', 'keyboard', 'positive')]

another expensive & poorly executed samsung product .####[('samsung product', 'laptop', 'negative')]
thankfully , this time , acer has gotten that part right .####[('acer', 'company', 'positive')]
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####[('toshiba', 'laptop', 'positive'), ('screen', 'display', 'positive'), ('build quality', 'laptop', 'negative')]
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####[('device', 'laptop', 'negative')]
for home users , these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two - screening , to watching videos and calling family .####[('machines', 'laptop', 'positive')]
as a 5 - year chromebook veteran , i ' ve been waiting for this machine .####[('machine', 'laptop', 'positive')]
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####[('processor', 'cpu', 'negative'), ('processor', 'cpu', 'positive')]
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####[('chromebook', 'laptop', 'neutral')]
i also don ' t want the power cord draped down the right side and annoying me .####[('power cord', 'power supply', 'negative')]

maybe that ' s a consequence of how the retina display is built , but yeah , it ' s harder to keep the screen clean .####[('screen', 'display', 'negative')]

the retina screen is amazing .####[('retina screen', 'display', 'positive')]
less of a fault of the much lauded diving board and more a factor of the very well designed new hardware .####[('hardware', 'hardware', 'positive')]
not to mention , the touchbar is just another gimmicky addition to the ` ` future of apple ` ` ( really not as effective as one would think ) .####[('touchbar', 'keyboard', 'positive')]

usb port go dead until i do a restart .####[('usb port', 'ports', 'negative')]
now i ' m just down to some gripes that are probably here to stay : the bluetooth on this thing is really fussy , the non - functional video output ( using usb - c video out through an hdmi cable sends just a blank desktop background and no audio , even if i am playing a movie or youtube visibly on the c302 screen ) , and that it can ' t hold a vpn connection without dropping it every 20 - 30 minutes .####[('NULL', 'laptop', 'negative'), ('bluetooth', 'hardware', 'negative')]
sometimes they felt a bit half - baked , but i loved the idea , and the keyboard made a world of difference in what you could do with that tablet .####[('keyboard', 'keyboard', 'positive'), ('NULL', 'laptop', 'positive')]

unlike other asus laptops i ' ve tried , this unit won the display roulette .####[('unit', 'laptop', 'positive')]
the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####[('native chrome os media player', 'software', 'negative')]
i like the security built in .####[('NULL', 'software', 'positive')]
if i had it to do over , i would not purchase this computer .####[('computer', 'laptop', 'negative')]
