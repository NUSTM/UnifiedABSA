the unit cost $ 275 to start with , so it is not worth repairing .####[('unit', 'laptop', 'negative')]
going from acer 15 to acer 11 was difficult , 11 inches seems too small for me .####[('acer 11', 'laptop', 'negative')]

the computer has difficulty switching between tablet and computer .####[('computer', 'laptop', 'negative')]
2 / 28 / 18 - a couple days ago i updated the chrome os .####[('chrome os', 'os', 'neutral')]
it ' s just that chrome doesn ' t work the same with a chromebook as it does with windows .####[('chrome', 'os', 'negative')]
hopefully in 10 years they ' ll have this figured out and it won ' t suck so badly .####[('NULL', 'laptop', 'negative')]

i was excited to receive this chromebook , only to watch that excitement dissipate within mere hours as i noticed the touchscreen did n ' t work at all on tablet mode .####[('touchscreen', 'hardware', 'negative')]
clearly there is some kind of major defect here that acer has n ' t resolved .####[('acer', 'company', 'negative')]

it boots up in 10 seconds and shuts down in 2 to 3 seconds .####[('shuts down', 'laptop', 'positive'), ('boots up', 'laptop', 'positive')]
i like the idea that the keyboard lights up and has a ` ` time out ` ` feature to shut off .####[('keyboard', 'keyboard', 'positive')]

easily upgrade to storage and ram .####[('ram', 'memory', 'positive')]
this does not really matter to me because the mx150 is enough for my needs .####[('mx150', 'graphics', 'neutral')]

graphics are good for the level of this laptop .####[('graphics', 'graphics', 'positive')]
finally got the warranty honored after almost 6 months .####[('warranty', 'warranty', 'negative')]
plenty of buyer returned it since the touch screen has phantom touch problems right after unboxing or it will eventually happen within 3 months .####[('touch screen', 'display', 'negative')]
consequently , i am no longer covered and my otherwise great chromebook becomes unusable anytime the phantom touches appear .####[('phantom touches', 'keyboard', 'negative'), ('chromebook', 'laptop', 'positive')]
i have tried to fix the pixel with online videos and websites with no effect .####[('pixel', 'display', 'negative')]
the beautiful screen is said to be identical to the pixelbook in size , aspect ratio , and resolution .####[('screen', 'display', 'positive')]
after using the 3 : 2 aspect ratio , i think i prefer it to normal 16 : 9 , as far as chromebooks go .####[('NULL', 'display', 'neutral')]
it was fine for a solid two days , from there on it has been nonstop , reset to factory settings .####[('NULL', 'laptop', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'laptop', 'positive')]
idk if that ' s how chromeos usually is , or maybe there is something wrong with the hardware but this is very annoying .####[('hardware', 'hardware', 'negative')]
i get that this is meant to store everything in the cloud so it should be no big deal , but when your trying to get work done where there is no access to the internet ( since google docs works offline ) it is practically useless when it has to reset itself to factory settings just after turning it on .####[('NULL', 'os', 'negative')]
the touch screen works wonderfully .####[('touch screen', 'display', 'positive')]
as others have noted , the backspace key is small .####[('backspace key', 'keyboard', 'negative')]
my biggest irk today though is that the screen is not very durable .####[('screen', 'display', 'negative')]
hard reboot , reset , refresh + power , esc + refresh + power , charging , letting it drain , nothing brought it back to life .####[('NULL', 'laptop', 'negative')]
needless to say trip number three to best buy was a pure return , since being 0 / 2 on such an expensive device leaves a bad taste , you know ?####[('device', 'laptop', 'negative')]
gorgeous screen , small profile , lightweight , built in stylus , i could go on and on about how awesome this thing was .####[('profile', 'laptop', 'positive'), ('stylus', 'hardware', 'positive'), ('screen', 'display', 'positive')]
this review might be dismissed as i am missing the ` ` verified purchase ` ` stamp , which is fair .####[('verified purchase', 'support', 'neutral')]
i wouldn ' t recommend this as a starting computer for children because they ' d learn incorrect navigation and have to adapt later to standard laptops .####[('NULL', 'laptop', 'negative')]
look , dont buy it .####[('NULL', 'laptop', 'negative')]
the screen does look good .####[('screen', 'display', 'positive')]
terrible quality and not really enjoyable to use apps on the playstore .####[('NULL', 'laptop', 'negative'), ('apps', 'software', 'negative')]
battery life its ok .####[('battery life', 'battery', 'neutral')]
then i got it home , worked with it for awhile , and realized just how easy it is to misfire unless you land dead nuts center in the middle of the key on your stroke .####[('NULL', 'keyboard', 'negative')]
another star off for android app support , which simply isn ' t ready for prime time .####[('android app support', 'software', 'negative')]
i didn ' t find a single android app that was optimized for chrome os ( not that my search was exhaustive , admittedly ) , so was disappointed pretty much every time .####[('android app', 'software', 'negative')]
battery life was mediocre , too , come to think of it .####[('battery life', 'battery', 'neutral')]
amazon gave me the option of returning for refund or trying to have it repaired .####[('amazon', 'support', 'neutral')]
battery is good , display and keyboard are pretty great .####[('keyboard', 'keyboard', 'positive'), ('battery', 'battery', 'positive'), ('display', 'display', 'positive')]
there ' s nothing ` ` pro ` ` about this tablet .####[('tablet', 'laptop', 'negative')]
unless it ' s a really bad baby and chromeos + samsung = bad baby !####[('chromeos', 'laptop', 'negative'), ('samsung', 'company', 'negative')]
sounds nice until you realize that your computer just doesn ' t let you do things and then calls it secure .####[('computer', 'laptop', 'negative')]
the keyboard lacks a backlight which is inconvenient in low light situations .####[('keyboard', 'keyboard', 'negative')]
when you stack up all these strengths and offer them at a price of $ 299 , you ' re getting a fairly impressive value proposition here with this chromebook .####[('chromebook', 'laptop', 'positive')]
at $ 300 , this is a great purchase .####[('NULL', 'laptop', 'positive')]
which leads me to my next point , the omnipresent comments about ` ` this feels like a $ 1000 computer ! ` `####[('NULL', 'laptop', 'positive')]
this isn ' t say the acer is bad in the abstract ; far from it .####[('acer', 'company', 'positive')]
it has a nice , oversize trackpad that - like pretty much all chromebooks - is responsive and a pleasure to use .####[('trackpad', 'keyboard', 'positive')]
the performance never lags , it meets the 10 - 12 hour battery life promise in my usage tests , and it ' s quickly become my go - to computer for both home and work .####[('battery life', 'battery', 'positive')]
this unit not only has a nice aluminum shell ( which is very attractive ) , but it also has a decent keyboard , with much better tactile properties than any chromebooks i ' ve looked at in the past .####[('aluminum shell', 'laptop', 'positive'), ('keyboard', 'laptop', 'positive')]
when i was comparing this model against other manufacturer ' s / model ' s , the only thing that made me pause was the lack of a card reader / writer .####[('card reader / writer', 'ports', 'negative')]
i love it !####[('NULL', 'laptop', 'positive')]
this isn ' t a powerhouse , i ' ve never pushed it , it probably wouldn ' t handle the 20 + tabs over multiple windows / desktops that i ' m used to on chrome on the desktop , but for 99 % of ` ` regular people ` ` this is an unbelievably good laptop .####[('it', 'laptop', 'positive')]
the battery life is incredible and charges from 0 % to 100 % in about an hour and a half while in use .####[('battery life', 'battery', 'positive')]
overall , it performs well enough for my daily internet needs .####[('NULL', 'laptop', 'positive')]
my only wish is that it were a little more quick / less laggy given it is a chromebook - but for the price point its a great buy .####[('NULL', 'laptop', 'positive')]
little bit of a learning curve with chrome os .####[('chrome os', 'os', 'negative')]
