always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####[('asus', 'company general', 'positive'), ('machines', 'laptop general', 'positive')]

another expensive & poorly executed samsung product .####[('samsung product', 'laptop price', 'negative'), ('samsung product', 'laptop operation performance', 'negative')]

for home users , these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two - screening , to watching videos and calling family .####[('machines', 'laptop price', 'positive'), ('machines', 'laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####[('processor', 'cpu price', 'positive'), ('processor', 'cpu operation performance', 'negative')]
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####[('chromebook', 'laptop quality', 'neutral')]
i was extremely hesitant to buy a used macbook pro ( it ' s still a lot of money ) but so far am surprisingly pleased with it .####[('macbook pro', 'laptop general', 'neutral'), ('macbook pro', 'laptop general', 'positive')]
- new ports that were not in the 2011 model : hdmi port , extra thunderbolt video port ( now it has two instead of one )####[('ports', 'ports general', 'positive')]

* extremely weak graphics card .####[('graphics card', 'graphics operation performance', 'negative')]
i can ' t use my printer because it ' s not supported .####[('printer', 'ports usability', 'negative')]
now i ' m just down to some gripes that are probably here to stay : the bluetooth on this thing is really fussy , the non - functional video output ( using usb - c video out through an hdmi cable sends just a blank desktop background and no audio , even if i am playing a movie or youtube visibly on the c302 screen ) , and that it can ' t hold a vpn connection without dropping it every 20 - 30 minutes .####[('bluetooth', 'hardware operation performance', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'laptop connectivity', 'negative')]
the funny part is that the customer service people have been great but they have no control to take care of problems .####[('customer service', 'support general', 'positive')]

the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####[('native chrome os media player', 'software operation performance', 'negative')]
it also had charging problems and got terrible warranty support .####[('NULL', 'power supply general', 'negative'), ('warranty support', 'warranty general', 'negative')]
if bluetooth devices worked with this chromebook it would get 5 stars , but this is the least reliable device in regards to bluetooth i have ever owned .####[('chromebook', 'laptop general', 'positive')]
was initially impressed by design but after normal use without any rough handling or dropping of the chromebook , the metal corner tip covering the lcd peels off & warps / bends upwards !####[('metal corner tip', 'hardware quality', 'negative')]
games / video apps perform absolutely awfully .####[('games / video apps', 'software operation performance', 'negative')]
after one charge , the battery would not take charge .####[('battery', 'battery operation performance', 'negative')]

one of the keys is especially flimsy and feels like it could break at any moment .####[('one of the keys', 'keyboard quality', 'negative')]
similarly the task tray area of the main task bar is on the small side and lends itself to fat - fingering .####[('task tray area', 'software design features', 'negative')]
a big part of this device is its gorgeous aesthetic .####[('device', 'laptop design features', 'positive')]
this is a great device and the $ 450 asking price seems fair .####[('device', 'laptop price', 'neutral'), ('device', 'laptop general', 'positive')]
quality is excellent so far , and the software / hardware combination works like they were made for each other ( which is what you want : ) )####[('quality', 'laptop quality', 'positive'), ('software', 'software operation performance', 'positive'), ('hardware', 'hardware operation performance', 'positive')]
it ' s sturdy , and looks and feels great .####[('NULL', 'laptop design features', 'positive')]
