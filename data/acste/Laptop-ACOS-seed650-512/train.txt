for reference : ive had this laptop for about 4 months now for my first year at college .####[('laptop', 'laptop general', 'neutral')]

if you are wanting a beautiful screen that beats all other tablets for color range and matches samsung ' s galaxy tab s3 ( top android tablet ) , but if you absolutely must have a keyboard , don ' t buy this .####[('keyboard', 'keyboard general', 'negative'), ('screen', 'display design features', 'positive')]
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .####[('screen', 'display operation performance', 'negative')]
to make things worse , i currently live overseas and am highly doubtful that samsung would do anything about this , given that it was bought in the us .####[('samsung', 'support operation performance', 'negative')]
in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this product given the obvious history of quality control issues .####[('product', 'laptop quality', 'negative')]
i ' m surprised people are settling for claiming ` ` it ' s good enough ` ` or ` ` gets the job done ` ` when every time i use it , i ' m constantly reminded of how i should have just sprang for the pixelbook when it was on sale for $ 699 .####[('NULL', 'laptop price', 'negative')]
my 2nd issues is with it ' s performance .####[('NULL', 'laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
it ' s also worth noting my unit came with a floating trackpad , with initial play before the actually click .####[('trackpad', 'display operation performance', 'negative')]
possible note , it was very light .####[('NULL', 'laptop portability', 'positive')]
while this thing is gorgeous and the perfect size for what i was looking for , my initial display died after not even 12 hours of use .####[('NULL', 'laptop general', 'positive'), ('NULL', 'laptop design features', 'positive')]
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####[('device', 'laptop price', 'negative')]
it is very limited and the competition for an actual usable operating system that can do a lot more than just browse the internet , are available .####[('NULL', 'laptop operation performance', 'negative'), ('operating system', 'os operation performance', 'negative')]
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####[('keyboard', 'keyboard general', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'laptop design features', 'negative')]
this is quite honest , a very expensive chrome browser .####[('chrome browser', 'laptop price', 'negative')]
i do not recommend it at this price point .####[('NULL', 'laptop price', 'negative')]
after a couple of weeks i started experiencing web browsing issues .####[('web browsing', 'software operation performance', 'negative')]
first occasionally and later to a point where the laptop became unusable .####[('laptop', 'laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####[('stylus', 'hardware operation performance', 'negative')]
i went in to this purchase assuming that the availability of android apps from the google play store would make this unit into a true windows alternative .####[('android apps', 'software usability', 'negative')]
so one star off for the keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'keyboard general', 'negative')]
needless to say , if you thought this capability would allow you to use a browser other than chrome , forget it .####[('NULL', 'os operation performance', 'negative')]
the problem is that it never charged .####[('NULL', 'laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i really needed this product for work and had big plans for using it ' s features / versatility .####[('product', 'laptop operation performance', 'neutral')]
apparently there is some optimizations that google has done with the op1 and pixel that allow what is called instant ink .####[('google', 'company operation performance', 'positive')]
i have also noticed the pro seems to run hotter and have a noticeably shorter battery life .####[('battery life', 'battery operation performance', 'negative'), ('pro', 'fans&cooling operation performance', 'negative')]

samsung makes garbage and treats their customers with no respect .####[('samsung', 'company general', 'negative')]
chrome os is not matured in any way .####[('chrome os', 'laptop general', 'negative')]
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####[('chromeos', 'os usability', 'negative')]
it is solid , and does a decent job rendering pages , and paired with the extra ram here , it adequately handles streaming content in the background - such as youtube or spotify - and still maintains a decent browsing experience across eight to ten additional tabs ;####[('NULL', 'laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####[('acer chromebook 14', 'laptop general', 'positive')]

the hardware specs on this are very nice compared to other offerings : 4g ram , 32g storage , quad - core processor , etc .####[('hardware specs', 'hardware general', 'positive')]
the mouse area is responsive , and has a nice feel to it .####[('mouse area', 'keyboard operation performance', 'positive')]
the overall unit has a slim profile , and is light weight .####[('unit', 'laptop design features', 'positive')]
i think biggest reason i like it is that it ' s sturdy and i don ' t mind throwing it in and out of my backpack whereas with a $ 1000 mb air i might be a whole lot more careful in how i handle it .####[('NULL', 'laptop quality', 'positive')]
hope to continue to get many more years of use out of it !####[('NULL', 'laptop general', 'positive')]

one thing keeps it from getting a five - star rave from me .####[('NULL', 'laptop design features', 'negative')]
the keyboard is good .####[('keyboard', 'keyboard general', 'positive')]
but the 4 gb of ram makes the things you use a chromebook for work without delay .####[('ram', 'memory operation performance', 'positive')]
where they didn ' t sacrifice is on build quality .####[('build quality', 'laptop quality', 'positive')]

i could not be happier with this computer because i am not the best person with technology .####[('computer', 'laptop usability', 'positive')]

this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .####[('trackpad', 'keyboard general', 'positive')]
sure , another generation back was arguably better , but i find this computer to be adequate to my needs right now ( though it is a disappointment that i can ' t upgrade the ram , which definitely limits the lifetime of how long this product will last ) .####[('computer', 'laptop general', 'neutral')]

the mbp does not run as hot as my old white mb did .####[('mbp', 'laptop quality', 'neutral')]
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####[('chrome', 'software operation performance', 'negative'), ('apps', 'software operation performance', 'negative'), ('google docs / drive', 'software general', 'neutral')]

i was super worried that touching the keyboard when it was in tablet mode would cause it to switch back to laptop mode , but it looks like once you move the screen back past like 180 degrees , it goes into full touchscreen .####[('keyboard', 'keyboard usability', 'negative')]
