on weekends , you might have to wait for couple hours .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'neutral')]
however , they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'positive')]

the price was right too .####[('NULL', 'restaurant prices', 'positive')]
i ' d go back there in a heartbeat .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
well i guess it ' s hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff .####[('staff', 'service general', 'negative')]
once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
the prior reviews said kid friendly . . . give me a break with two young children that is light years .####[('NULL', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]

if you ' re going to see danny gans or just staying at the mirage , do n ' t miss this one .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
completely over rated !####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'negative')]
even then , the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
we had a very hard time getting the waitress ' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .####[('waitress', 'service general', 'negative')]
as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 % discount on our bill .####[('owner', 'service general', 'negative')]
when the bill came , he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
it was clear he didn ’ t really care .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
– save yourself the waste of time & do not visit .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'negative')]
after sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes i left .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n ' t work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link .####[('restaurant', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
i never heard back from anyone more than a month ago .####[('NULL', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
after sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she ' d be right with us .####[('bar keep', 'service general', 'negative')]
as of writing this i just tried their give away a link again & it still does n ' t work .####[('NULL', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
always a winner .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
she does n ' t make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
but she is very friendly with certain people , making it even more annoying .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners .####[('waitstaff', 'service general', 'negative'), ('management', 'service general', 'negative')]
they have been featured on the food network and they deserve it .####[('NULL', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive')]
does n ' t get any better than that .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
you can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing .####[('NULL', 'ambience general', 'positive')]
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up .####[('NULL', 'ambience general', 'positive')]
first off , the food came fast and all together : ) i like that . . . i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'positive')]
yummy .####[('NULL', 'food quality', 'positive')]
not chewy at all .####[('NULL', 'food quality', 'positive')]
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee . . . oh la la yummy ! ! !####[('mango ginger creme brulee', 'food quality', 'positive')]
melt in your mouth .####[('NULL', 'food quality', 'positive')]
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant .####[('restaurant', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel . . . but they are definitely one you dont want to miss , esp if your in downtown san jose .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
we easily spent more than $ 40 per person ( not including alcohol ) and were still hungry .####[('NULL', 'restaurant prices', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'food style options', 'negative')]
i ' m astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ .####[('restaurant', 'restaurant prices', 'negative')]
we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it ' d be a 30 minute wait .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
we went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago ! !####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
none that i can think of .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'negative')]
we put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n ' t arrive until 45 minutes later . . . with our main course .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
um so now what are appetizers for ? ? ?####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
oh i forgot to mention that they do n ' t have bread service .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water ( she had a sore throat ) and i guess that since it was only water , it was n ' t a priority for them to actually bring it .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
in other words , if they are n ' t making $ $ off of you then you do n ' t rate high on their ' service scale ' .####[('service', 'service general', 'negative')]
its great if you spent the day there and did n ' t want to drive to eat .####[('NULL', 'location general', 'positive')]
parking is reasonably good , they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby .####[('NULL', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive')]
always good .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
6pm on a sat before a broadway play and we were quickly seated and served .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'positive')]
as part of a small party of four , our food was dropped off without comment ;####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
when we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment - - to say we had been ` ` blown off ' ' would be an understatement .####[('manager', 'service general', 'negative')]
the manager continually interrupted with ` ` is there anything else i can do for you ? ` ` , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .####[('manager', 'service general', 'negative')]
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n ' t bothered to get the waitresses name .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
in short , schooner or later could n ' t have cared less about our being at their establishment .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
you are with a hot date and he / she has an urge for sushi . . . then this might be the place .####[('sushi', 'food quality', 'positive')]

we were only in seattle for one night and i ' m so glad we picked rays for dinner !####[('rays', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
this is the case at this gem .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
you ca n ' t go wrong here .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
seriously , you ca n ' t go wrong , if it is unpretentious local fun you seek .####[('NULL', 'ambience general', 'positive')]
my mouth felt very dry afterwards and i had that signature ? msg ? taste lingering in my throat after i left the restaurant .####[('NULL', 'food quality', 'negative')]
they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and not - too - sweet .####[('NULL', 'food quality', 'positive')]
the dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip , almost $ 50 / pp after tax and tip ( about average ) .####[('NULL', 'restaurant prices', 'neutral'), ('NULL', 'service general', 'positive')]
just remember to dress a little urban - chic so you don ? t look too far out of place .####[('NULL', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'neutral')]
very good !####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
overpriced####[('NULL', 'restaurant prices', 'negative')]
waited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'neutral')]
not sure if i would go back .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'negative')]
in fact , many want to return a second time during their visit .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
they are n ' t the most talkative , but everytime i ' ve been there they have been very busy , which probably accounts for the lack of conversation .####[('NULL', 'service general', 'neutral')]
it ' s just the right size for the menu .####[('NULL', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive')]
excellent####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
you never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there .####[('NULL', 'food quality', 'positive')]

will definitely be back .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
delicious . . . !####[('NULL', 'food quality', 'positive')]
delectable####[('NULL', 'food quality', 'positive')]
once you ' re inside , the real experience begins .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]
i probably would n ' t go back though ' cuz i do n ' t know if it ' s worth it .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'negative')]
maybe i ' ll go back once more many years from now when i ' ve forgotten i went there already .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'negative')]
sit in the balcony####[('balcony', 'ambience general', 'neutral')]
– not bad .####[('NULL', 'restaurant general', 'neutral')]

our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times .####[('server', 'service general', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'service general', 'positive')]
should check - up on us more frequently , do n ' t you think ?####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]
the most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places .####[('NULL', 'restaurant prices', 'positive')]
i felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom .####[('NULL', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]

insultingly overpriced####[('NULL', 'restaurant prices', 'negative')]
- mediocre service / quality####[('service', 'service general', 'neutral')]
to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .####[('manager', 'service general', 'negative'), ('NULL', 'service general', 'positive')]
two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner . . . they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table .####[('NULL', 'restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
