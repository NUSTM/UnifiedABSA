I took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .####['salmon', ['dry', 'bland', 'fishy']]
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .####['manager', ['bad']]
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .####['drinks', ['enjoy']]

Fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off –####['food', ['Fabulous']]
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .####['waiters', ['fantastic']]

There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .####['girl', ['uninvited']]
Considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service .####['service', ['expect better']]
