anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####['ssd', ['fixable', 'luck']]

only con would be that display is not that bright , although i would say at the brightest setting is probably where it should be .####['display', ['con']]

the only thing i did not like about the design is the fact that the speakers are on the bottom of the unit .####['speakers', ['not like']]
the only real upgrade for the new one , before adding on options is faster memory .####['memory', ['faster']]
i run windows and linux vms fairly regularly and while i could run them on a comparable windows system , adding windows systems to an already portly windows system has never worked out well for me , so while disappointed in the new upgrades , this 2015 model still rocks vms and does all i need it too for far less $ $ $ .####['the new upgrades', ['disappointed']]
while usb - c is cool , a bag full of dongles is not .####['usb - c', ['cool']]

super fast boot .####['boot', ['fast']]
with magsafe 2 , even the gentlest pull makes the plug to disconnect , which is very annoying for me .####['plug', ['annoying']]
it ' s very expensive for such a simple device .####['device', ['expensive']]
i ' m okay with that given that the body is thinner .####['body', ['thinner']]
in the beginning i felt a little weird about this trackpad .####['trackpad', ['weird']]

the keyboard is ok .####['keyboard', ['ok']]
other than that , the key sizes are good and the backlighting works just fine .####['backlighting', ['fine']]

i have not messed with the continuity feature much , but it is nice having the favorites and open tabs sync from my laptop to my iphone .####['continuity feature', ['favorites', 'nice']]
the current model only has two , which can be problematic if you hook up an external hard drive and an external bluray drive ( which requires two ports ) at the same time .####['model', ['problematic']]
it ' s nice and lightweight , the sd port is useful , and it ' s powerful enough for me to do fairly layer intensive graphic design work in photoshop and basic grading in lightroom .####['sd port', ['useful']]
the keys feel fantastic to type on .####['keys', ['fantastic']]
the overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold .####['design', ['pleasing', 'sleek']]

the key board is one of the best i ' ve ever typed on .####['key board', ['best']]
the battery life is really pretty comparable ( slightly more with the mbp , and i can obtain info on app energy usage a bit easier imo ) .####['battery life', ['comparable']]
the mbp trackpad is best in class and if you are not using a mouse , this makes a huge difference .####['mbp trackpad', ['best']]
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####['apps', ['drawback']]
an unexpected benefit for me has been the iphone / mbp integration .####['iphone / mbp integration', ['benefit']]
i love the airdrop and receiving imessages on my mbp ( although it can cut into productivity if you ' re not careful ) .####['airdrop', ['love']]

with the windows 10 / directx 12 improvements , frostbite 3 games will do very well on this machine at 1050p graphics / medium / low with the new starwars game .####['machine', ['well']]
