It 's a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend ( Thurs ? Sun ) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar .####[('place', 'tiny')]
Everything , and I mean everything on the menu is delectable .####[('menu', 'delectable')]
The waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .####[('waiters', 'helpful'), ('waiters', 'experienced')]
The sushi is as fresh as it comes ? you 'd think ocean was in their backyard , no joke !####[('sushi', 'fresh')]
If you 're interested in good tasting ( without the fish taste or smell ) , large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place ...####[('sushi dishes', 'creative'), ('portions', 'large')]
big thick pepperoni####[('pepperoni', 'big thick')]
– The pepperoni 's cut real thick -- Yum .####[("pepperoni 's", 'thick'), ("pepperoni 's", 'Yum')]
The pizza itself is not exactly the best I 've had EVER , but still pretty good .####[('pizza', 'good'), ('pizza', 'not exactly the best')]
Food was good and appetizing .####[('Food', 'good'), ('Food', 'appetizing')]
Portions was just enough for me , but may not be for a big eater .####[('Portions', 'enough')]
Fair menu selection .####[('menu selection', 'Fair')]
The appetizer was interesting , but the Creme Brulee was very savory and delicious .####[('Creme Brulee', 'savory'), ('appetizer', 'interesting'), ('Creme Brulee', 'delicious')]

I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd .####[('restroom', 'odd')]

- Mediocre Service / Quality####[('Service', 'Mediocre')]
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu .####[('Snooze', 'excellent'), ('menu', 'high brow')]
They serve it in a tall , skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .####[('juice', 'small')]
I should have just asked for the check when I saw that ; but their menu was so unique that I continued .####[('menu', 'unique')]
The pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 '' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 '' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over-priced .####[('pancakes', 'over-priced'), ('pancakes', 'inventive')]
The pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 '' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .####[('pancakes', 'should be larger')]
In the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( I had water ) .####[('pancakes', 'small')]

For my entr & eacute ; e , I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano .####[('seared Alaskan sea scallops', 'enjoyed')]

My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .####[('grilled Alaskan King Salmon', 'enjoyed'), ('green beans', 'crisp'), ('creamed Washington russet potatoes', 'delectable')]

Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but I did remain puzzled by one issue : Who thinks that Ray 's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?####[('server', 'attentive'), ("Ray 's", 'appropriate')]
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .####[('server', 'wonderful'), ('food', 'wonderful')]
