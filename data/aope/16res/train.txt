I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .####[('white organza tent', 'gorgeous'), ('four course prix fix menu', 'enjoyed')]
The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing !####[('service', 'spectacular'), ('waiter', 'amazing')]
I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date .####[('Casa La Femme', 'recommend')]
The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling .####[('bibimbap', 'average'), ('stone bowl', "was n't even close to sizzling")]
Too bad I had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .####[('stone bowl', 'bad')]
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I 've ever tasted .####[('stir-fried squid', 'worst')]
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service .####[('service', 'lack of')]
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .####[('mashed yukon potatoes', 'tasty'), ('farro salad', 'tasty')]
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza####[('east village pizza', 'love'), ('margherita pizza', 'looove')]
Love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go .####[('place', 'Love')]
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza .####[('slice of NYC pizza', 'quintessential')]
Personally I like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .####[('margherita pizza', 'like')]
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City####[('Restaurant', 'Romantic')]
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that don ’ t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !####[('modern Japanese brasserie', 'romantic'), ('modern Japanese brasserie', 'favorite')]
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city .####[('spot', 'hidden'), ('décor', 'intimate')]
If you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .####[('private booths', 'ushered')]
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .####[('sashimi amuse bouche', 'delightful')]
For desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .####[('frozen black sesame mousse', 'interesting'), ('frozen black sesame mousse', 'extraordinary'), ('matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake', 'phenomenal')]
Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just can ’ t say enough good things about this brasserie .####[('brasserie', 'good')]
They are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !####[('service', 'horrible')]
Great Shabu Shabu####[('Shabu Shabu', 'Great')]
I tried a couple other dishes but was n't too impressed .####[('dishes', "was n't too impressed")]
The meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .####[('kimchi', 'free'), ('service', 'good'), ('meat', 'fresh'), ('salad', 'free'), ('sauces', 'great')]
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .####[('Korean food', 'classic'), ('fusion twists', 'classic'), ('pork belly tacos', 'classic')]
The food tasted very good .####[('food', 'good')]
The main entree was also very good .####[('main entree', 'good')]
This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ...####[('decor', 'weird'), ('mirrored walls', 'dizzy'), ('mirrored walls', 'delusional')]
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n't work .####[('japanese tapas', "does n't work")]
The food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked .####[('food', 'uncooked'), ('food', 'not appetizing'), ('food', 'not comforting')]
Good Food####[('Food', 'Good')]
The food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I do n't like being cramp in a corner .####[('food', 'tasty'), ('food', 'great'), ('sitting space', 'too small')]
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .####[('place', 'nice romantic')]
The atmosphere was great .####[('atmosphere', 'great')]
Our waitress was n't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####[('waitress', 'not especially warm or attentive'), ('waitress', "was n't mean")]
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####[('restaurant', 'bad')]
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .####[('servers', 'perfected')]
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####[('server', 'enhanced'), ('appetizer', 'delicious')]
Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest .####[('food', 'good')]
The place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins )####[('furnishings', 'attractive'), ('fit-out', 'nice'), ('wine list', 'reasonable')]
Everything was going good until we got our meals .####[('meals', 'good')]
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .####[('chicken', 'appalled')]
It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .####[('spinach', 'undercooked')]
I took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .####[('salmon', 'fishy'), ('salmon', 'bland'), ('salmon', 'dry')]
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .####[('manager', 'bad')]
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .####[('appetizers', 'enjoy'), ('drinks', 'enjoy')]
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .####[('STAFF', 'FIRED')]
cirspy crust margherita pizza####[('margherita pizza', 'cirspy crust')]
it was really good pizza .####[('pizza', 'good')]
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded : ) : ) : )####[('pizza', 'fully loaded'), ('crust', 'cooked well')]
Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan####[('Restaurant', 'Worst')]
I 'll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .####[('pita', 'good'), ('decor', 'cool'), ('hummus', 'good'), ('grilled octopus', 'tasty')]
It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .####[('scene', 'spectacular')]
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME ! ! ! !####[('eggplant', 'cold'), ('decor', 'distraction')]
Great Hot Dogs !####[('Hot Dogs', 'Great')]
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !####[('Bark', 'worth')]
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off –####[('food', 'Fabulous')]
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .####[('waiters', 'fantastic'), ('front of house staff', 'hideous'), ('fish dishes', 'exceptional')]
As BFC does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####[('front of house staff', 'abused')]
The frizzy retro girl ( with winged/ Dame Edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .####[('girl', 'frizzy')]
I 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !####[('staff', 'horrified')]
There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .####[('girl', 'uninvited')]
Considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service .####[('service', 'expect better')]
The food and service were fine , however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .####[('service', 'fine'), ('maitre-D', 'arrogant'), ('maitre-D', 'unwelcoming'), ('food', 'fine')]
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .####[('bottle of wine', 'high-end')]
Best meal in a long time !####[('meal', 'Best')]
My father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish .####[('flank steak', 'good')]
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience .####[('The Four Seasons restaurant', 'great')]
The food is great and the environment is even better .####[('food', 'great'), ('environment', 'better')]
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .####[('hot dog', 'elevated')]
Great Atmosphere####[('Atmosphere', 'Great')]
I highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .####[('fish tacos', 'recommend')]
Cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .####[('atmosphere', 'Cool')]
Poor service and management####[('management', 'Poor'), ('service', 'Poor')]
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner .####[('Casa la Femme', 'awful')]
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .####[('manager', 'rude')]
Can ’ t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .####[('restaurant', 'expensive')]
The food is very good , but not outstanding .####[('food', 'good'), ('food', 'not outstanding')]
The bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .####[('salad', 'overpriced'), ('bread', 'stale'), ('salad', 'empty')]
The pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .####[('pasta', 'well cooked')]
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .####[('hostess', 'rude')]
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .####[('bartender', 'disappeared')]
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service .####[('customer service', 'non-existent'), ('staff', 'rude')]
bad staff####[('staff', 'bad')]
I generally like this place .####[('place', 'like')]
The food is good .####[('food', 'good')]
