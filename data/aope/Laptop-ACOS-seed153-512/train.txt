runs good , poor battery life .####[('battery life', 'poor')]
to my great dismay and disappointment , the power icon read the exact same message : ` ` plugged in , not charging ` ` .####[('power icon', 'dismay'), ('power icon', 'disappointment')]
the built - in speaker is below average .####[('built - in speaker', 'below average')]
no backlit keyboard is kinda a bummer but i digress .####[('backlit keyboard', 'bummer')]
i went with the asus vivobook based on the good specs , better hdd and ram , reviews , and because i could pay for it over several months .####[('hdd', 'better'), ('specs', 'good'), ('ram', 'better')]
edit : reinstalled the driver now the audio is better on earphones .####[('audio', 'better')]
with ssd lightning fast start up####[('ssd', 'fast')]

the new computer failed again with the same error .####[('computer', 'failed')]
the computer worked well for a few weeks , then the screen backlight died .####[('computer', 'well'), ('screen backlight', 'died')]
the fan blows like crazy and it makes so much noise .####[('fan', 'crazy')]
i would not recommend you buying this laptop , the specs are fine for the price , but the hardware is rubbish .####[('specs', 'fine'), ('laptop', 'not recommend'), ('hardware', 'rubbish')]
all around , a very lacking laptop .####[('laptop', 'lacking')]
this computer arrived fine but will not charge .####[('computer', 'fine')]
i could n ' t have put my feelings about my new acer aspire e 15 e5 - 576g - 5762 better .####[('acer aspire e 15 e5 - 576g - 5762', 'better')]

oh , and the nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least ( grid autosport fps avg is in the 80s / 90s or so )####[('nvidia card', 'capable')]
+ great and fast cpu and overall fast pc performance####[('cpu', 'fast'), ('cpu', 'great')]
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####[('hd screen', 'decent')]
this laptop is the best for the price in my opinion .####[('laptop', 'best')]
i have been beyond pleased with this laptop purchase over the last 6 months of use .####[('laptop', 'pleased')]
it is also amazingly quiet : the ssd doesn ' t make any noise , and the fan only spins up if i am doing something intensive like playing games or running a heafty program - just browsing or watching videos / basic office work will not make this computer more than whisper .####[('ssd', 'amazingly')]
additionally , this has a nice backlight to the keyboard , which will turn off when nothing has been pressed for about 20 seconds ( great for when just watching or reading something ) or can be manually turned off entirely .####[('keyboard', 'nice'), ('keyboard', 'great')]

my first time with a solid state drive , very nice quick and quiet .####[('solid state drive', 'nice'), ('solid state drive', 'quiet')]
i will painfully learn the new pads .####[('pads', 'painfully')]
the screen is more than sufficient for non - gaming , business use , and it seems as fast as expected .####[('screen', 'fast'), ('screen', 'sufficient')]
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####[('ssd', 'luck'), ('ssd', 'fixable')]
