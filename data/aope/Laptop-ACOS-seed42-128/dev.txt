thankfully , this time , acer has gotten that part right .####[('acer', 'thankfully')]
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####[('toshiba', 'better'), ('screen', 'nicer'), ('build quality', 'less impressive')]
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####[('device', 'exaggerating')]

the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####[('native chrome os media player', 'frustrated')]
i feel like i bought a decent machine but it ' s unable to handle the ram workload .####[('machine', 'decent')]
