anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####[('ssd', 'fixable'), ('ssd', 'luck')]
