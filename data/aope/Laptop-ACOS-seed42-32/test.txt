battery is good , display and keyboard are pretty great .####[('battery', 'good'), ('keyboard', 'great'), ('display', 'great')]
the keyboard lacks a backlight which is inconvenient in low light situations .####[('keyboard', 'inconvenient')]

the battery life is incredible and charges from 0 % to 100 % in about an hour and a half while in use .####[('battery life', 'incredible')]

i was initially a little nervous as the system was somewhat glitchy for the first couple of weeks , seemed to be a problem with the chrome os because it was fixed by the next update .####[('system', 'nervous')]
battery : solid .####[('battery', 'solid')]
- speakers are a little tinny ( though the volume is awesome ) and it ' s not possible to customize the equalizer on the chrome os right now : (####[('speakers', 'awesome'), ('speakers', 'tinny')]
the touchscreen looks good and is responsive , and the keyboard is nice .####[('touchscreen', 'responsive'), ('keyboard', 'nice'), ('touchscreen', 'good')]
so i went to install my favorite screenwriting app , trelby , only to find its not available .####[('screenwriting app', 'favorite')]
overall : i like it and am happy for paying a bit over $ 200 for the 4gb model ( at the time of writing this , it sells for $ 220 new ) .####[('model', 'like')]
one plus i ' m particularly happy about : a quiet fan - less device that doesn ' t heat up too much !####[('fan - less device', 'quiet'), ('fan - less device', 'happy')]
i have to say , i was somewhat hesitant purchasing this chromebook mainly because of some of the reviews .####[('chromebook', 'hesitant')]
due to the excellent return policy on prime i decided to purchase this .####[('return policy', 'excellent')]
so far all but 1 of the android apps that i have tried have functioned properly , but some are restricted in the size of window that will work properly .####[('android apps', 'properly')]
laptop arrived dirty ( grimy screen and there was actual pet hair in the air vent ) .####[('laptop', 'dirty'), ('screen', 'grimy')]
i am not blaming the seller , i am blaming mac ' s os and its glitchy services .####[('seller', 'not blaming'), ('services', 'glitchy')]

i ' m still absolutely blown away how apple , a supposed industry leader , has such horrendous functionality .####[('apple', 'horrendous')]
i purchased this notebook back in july and was initially happy with my purchase .####[('notebook', 'happy')]
asus , has a horrible reputation .####[('asus', 'horrible')]
bright enough for all uses , and 1080p is perfect - images are sharp .####[('1080p', 'perfect'), ('1080p', 'bright')]
- battery life is solid , right around what is claimed - probably 7 to 10 hours depending on variables such as screen brightness and how demanding you ' re being with it .####[('battery life', 'solid')]
- touchscreen is responsive enough for gaming .####[('touchscreen', 'responsive')]
this screen ratio makes it look great in desktop mode .####[('screen ratio', 'great')]
if it is indeed a software thing and it ' s fixed , i would highly recommend this device .####[('device', 'recommend')]
the screen itself is hd 1080p but most ui elements don ' t look good in this resolution .####[('ui elements', "' t look good")]
• great battery life .####[('battery life', 'great')]
i would like a quick fix but have not found one that would allow me to consider keeping this beautiful asus chromebook .####[('asus chromebook', 'beautiful')]
then i one night i plugged it in and woke up to a dead chromebook .####[('chromebook', 'dead')]
it ' s too heavy to really use as a tablet .####[('tablet', 'heavy')]
this product was fantastic - - great build quality , screen resolution , keyboard - - until one day it stopped turning on .####[('screen resolution', 'great'), ('build quality', 'great'), ('keyboard', 'great'), ('product', 'fantastic')]
if this device weren ' t nearly $ 500 i might expect it to only last a year , but at this price point it ' s unacceptable .####[('device', 'unacceptable')]
the laptop was great , lightweight , booted fast , simple to use .####[('laptop', 'lightweight'), ('laptop', 'great'), ('laptop', 'fast'), ('laptop', 'simple')]
even just this last month it still rates ( on several tech sites ) as one of the best overall chromebook lines to get .####[('chromebook', 'best')]
the asus customer service people are rude and have no answers .####[('asus customer service people', 'rude')]
asus customer service sucks .####[('asus customer service', 'sucks')]
it is a beautiful , well built laptop .####[('laptop', 'beautiful'), ('laptop', 'well')]
that ' s nutty for an expensive premium product .####[('product', 'nutty'), ('product', 'expensive')]
i seriously love the product but i may have to return it .####[('product', 'love')]
very impressed with my first chromebook .####[('chromebook', 'impressed')]
i don ' t use it as much in tablet mode as i thought as it is a little heavy when in that configuration .####[('tablet mode', 'heavy')]
i had high hopes for this tablet / computer based on customer reviews .####[('tablet / computer', 'high')]
google docs work fine .####[('google docs', 'fine')]
so , guess i ' m screwed , because now after 6 months my tpm is no longer working and the whole computer is useless .####[('computer', 'useless')]
product is sturdy , lightweight , fast , and the battery runtime was as advertised !####[('product', 'sturdy'), ('product', 'fast'), ('product', 'lightweight')]
i had to buy a mouse because the touchpad is very sticky .####[('touchpad', 'sticky')]
not at all pleasant to use also , the screen quality is just so - so .####[('screen quality', 'so - so')]
several of my chrome extensions perform poorly and have to be disabled altogether which degrades my work production experience .####[('chrome extensions', 'poorly')]
however , 1 ) the speakers on this thing are horrible .####[('speakers', 'horrible')]
battery life is not good .####[('battery life', 'not good')]
but screen is very weird .####[('screen', 'weird')]
the intel m3 processor is amazing , this thing can do a ton of multi - tasking and the google play store is nice to have , the android apps variants trump the chromebook pre - loaded apps .####[('intel m3 processor', 'amazing'), ('google play store', 'nice')]
a great chromebook , but stopped charging in 3 months .####[('chromebook', 'great')]
i was really excited to purchase this product because it was more affordable .####[('product', 'affordable'), ('product', 'excited')]
chromebooks are cool , but they dont last at all .####[('chromebooks', 'cool')]
hey this machine is extremely useable and functionable .####[('machine', 'functionable'), ('machine', 'useable')]
furthermore , the file system is extremely complicated to use .####[('file system', 'complicated')]
the display panel on the machine i received is warped .####[('display panel on', 'warped')]
the machine looks great from the hardware point , but the whole concept of chrome os and cloud applications sucks .####[('cloud applications', 'sucks'), ('machine', 'great'), ('hardware', 'great'), ('chrome os', 'sucks')]
the screen hinge feels weak .####[('screen hinge', 'weak')]
screen is average by 2017 standards .####[('screen', 'average')]
the chromebook is brilliant overall .####[('chromebook', 'brilliant')]
horrible product .####[('product', 'horrible')]
tech support is no help unless you are willing to part with your computer for months without guarantee of return .####[('tech support', 'no help')]
i am having a very difficult time with this chromebook .####[('chromebook', 'difficult')]
the tablet mode is horribly integrated with the os and applications .####[('tablet mode', 'horribly'), ('applications', 'horribly'), ('os', 'horribly')]
this is nothing more than an okay laptop to get you through basic work activities .####[('laptop', 'okay')]
overall it ' s one of the nicest chrombooks out there .####[('chrombooks', 'nicest')]
however , mine came with an annoying trackpad .####[('trackpad', 'annoying')]
the top metal monitor casing seems to be soft and bendable .####[('top metal monitor casing', 'soft'), ('top metal monitor casing', 'bendable')]
mine arrived with the metal screen casing slightly bent , i can easily bend it back , not sure about the durability of this thing in the long term .####[('metal screen casing', 'bent')]
so chromebook with some manufacturing issues + bad customer service####[('customer service', 'bad')]
i find the chromium os to be very limiting and would not recommend it over a cheap windows pc .####[('windows pc', 'not recommend'), ('windows pc', 'cheap'), ('chromium os', 'limiting')]
the keyboard is fantastic , but it ' s just a keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'fantastic')]
the touchpad is also some strange off color plastic .####[('touchpad', 'strange')]
1 - faulty trackpad resulting in jerky erratic cursor movement relative to the smooth movement of your finger .####[('trackpad', 'jerky'), ('trackpad', 'erratic'), ('trackpad', 'faulty')]
however , if you want a really speedy chromebook , it ' s great .####[('chromebook', 'great'), ('chromebook', 'speedy')]
the first unit i received shortly died after a few hours of usage .####[('unit', 'died')]
trackpad is ok .####[('trackpad', 'ok')]
wireless card is finicky with both units i had .####[('wireless card', 'finicky')]
after being on the phone with technical support and windows support for a combined 10 hours , i am told that the hardware is defective and must be replaced .####[('hardware', 'defective')]
literally just closing it and opening it up later was a 50 / 50 proposition if it would wake up , or the display would crash , or the disk would crash , or some driver would fail - on a brand new laptop .####[('some driver', 'fail'), ('display', 'crash')]
by the time i was returning it , the system was in such poor shape from the msi .####[('system', 'poor')]
i believe if you happen to uninstall / install the drivers in exactly the correct order and / or do a clean win 10 installation yourself , this laptop should perform well for the price .####[('laptop', 'well')]
the sound is really terrible and tinny .####[('sound', 'terrible'), ('sound', 'tinny')]
excellent product####[('product', 'excellent')]
i ' ve always liked msi for their performance and fairly decent price .####[('msi', 'decent'), ('msi', 'liked')]
this laptop is not worth the time and definitely not the money .####[('laptop', 'not worth')]
i am extremely disappointed with this laptop .####[('laptop', 'disappointed')]
update : this is by far and away the worst computer i have ever purchased .####[('computer', 'worst')]

poor design and terrible tech support .####[('design', 'poor'), ('tech support', 'terrible')]
