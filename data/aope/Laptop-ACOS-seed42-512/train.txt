the replacement i got was much better , but still too slow for my expectations .####[('replacement', 'slow')]
october 12 , 2017 - - started having trouble maintaining connection to wifi ( spectrum service ) , but usually after several loops re - entering password , connection would be re - established .####[('wifi', 'trouble')]
now i ' m really bummed that i have a very nice looking chromebook with a beautiful screen that is totally unusable .####[('chromebook', 'unusable'), ('screen', 'beautiful'), ('chromebook', 'nice'), ('chromebook', 'bummed')]
keyboard key fragile .####[('keyboard', 'fragile')]
overall , it is not horrible , but i wouldn ' t purchase this model again .####[('model', 'not horrible')]
- screen feels smaller than other of the same size .####[('screen', 'smaller')]
the flip and touchscreen aspects work fine , no problems .####[('touchscreen', 'fine'), ('flip', 'fine')]
good display####[('display', 'good')]
my understanding is that chromeos is a very light weight so i don ' t know why it lags sometimes with under 10 tabs open and a youtube video playing .####[('chromeos', 'light')]
called acer support , they were completely useless .####[('acer support', 'useless')]
it feels like a tablet / computer for a child since it ' s so bulky and heavy .####[('computer', 'heavy'), ('computer', 'bulky'), ('tablet', 'heavy'), ('tablet', 'bulky')]
it appears the adapter may still be good as there are a few sparks when plugging into power but the charging light on the laptop does not come on and the battery is not charging .####[('adapter', 'good')]
the built - in speaker is below average .####[('built - in speaker', 'below average')]
aside from that , laptop seems fine .####[('laptop', 'fine')]
no backlit keyboard is kinda a bummer but i digress .####[('backlit keyboard', 'bummer')]
with this asus i ' m experiencing 2 very disappointing issues .####[('asus', 'disappointing')]
my friends , both female and male , are going to by this set up for their travel needs but for me it is lacking .####[('set up', 'lacking')]
should ' ve stick with my pixelbook which was awesome and never have me trouble .####[('pixelbook', 'awesome')]
i would not recommend you buying this laptop , the specs are fine for the price , but the hardware is rubbish .####[('specs', 'fine'), ('laptop', 'not recommend'), ('hardware', 'rubbish')]
* * returning the device - - that unhappy with the item .####[('device', 'unhappy'), ('item', 'unhappy')]
thanks to its ssd , it boots windows 10 pretty fast , bloatware is kept to a minimum ( please uninstall norton before doing anything else .####[('windows 10', 'fast')]
oh , and the nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least ( grid autosport fps avg is in the 80s / 90s or so )####[('nvidia card', 'capable')]
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####[('hd screen', 'decent')]
- trackpad is too finicky and not my favorite####[('trackpad', 'finicky')]
best pc bang for this level of buck .####[('pc bang', 'best')]
i highly recommend this laptop for anyone looking for a great performing machine with an outstanding price ( just to be clear , it won ' t be running the newest high - end games on ultra - high graphics settings , but it still performs phenomenally for its price range and usage category ) .####[('machine', 'outstanding'), ('laptop', 'phenomenally'), ('machine', 'great')]
it is also amazingly quiet : the ssd doesn ' t make any noise , and the fan only spins up if i am doing something intensive like playing games or running a heafty program - just browsing or watching videos / basic office work will not make this computer more than whisper .####[('ssd', 'amazingly')]
- the backlit keyboard looks nice .####[('backlit keyboard', 'nice')]
i will painfully learn the new pads .####[('pads', 'painfully')]
i ' ve owned several acer monitors that i ' ve always been pleased with , but this is the first computer .####[('computer', 'pleased'), ('acer monitors', 'pleased')]
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####[('ssd', 'luck'), ('ssd', 'fixable')]
the screen looks great ( though maybe not if all you do is look at 4k resolution ) and the keyboard response feels pretty good .####[('keyboard response', 'good'), ('screen', 'great')]
for the price , it ' s a solid laptop .####[('laptop', 'solid')]
the keyboard is easy to type on ( and the backlight is an added plus ) .####[('backlight', 'plus'), ('keyboard', 'easy')]
chromebooks are light weight and start up immediately and are very easy to use .####[('chromebooks', 'light'), ('chromebooks', 'easy')]

the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####[('start up', 'quick')]

i like everything about the device , but the beautiful touchscreen ended up malfunctioning about 6 - months after purchase .####[('touchscreen', 'beautiful'), ('device', 'like')]
in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this product given the obvious history of quality control issues .####[('product', 'cautious')]
first and foremost , lets talk about the infamous keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'infamous')]
awesome display .####[('display', 'awesome')]
mouse track pad is non standard .####[('mouse track pad', 'non standard')]
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####[('device', 'worth')]
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####[('stylus', 'failed'), ('stylus', 'stuck')]
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .####[('display', 'nice')]
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####[('acer chromebook 14', 'excellent')]
the keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice .####[('keyboard', 'nice')]
the keys on the keyboard are sunk in a little too low to accommodate for the sleek / thin profile .####[('keys on the keyboard are', 'low')]
the keyboard is good .####[('keyboard', 'good')]
the battery life has started to go down after a year of solid use ( still quite good ) , but the quality screen and chromeos make it worth it .####[('chromeos', 'quality'), ('chromeos', 'worth'), ('screen', 'worth'), ('battery life', 'good'), ('screen', 'quality'), ('battery life', 'solid')]
this acer chromebook 14 is by far the best chromebook 300 dollars can buy .####[('acer chromebook 14', 'best')]

the chromebook is quite ideal for those who use their computer mostly for surfing the internet .####[('chromebook', 'ideal')]

overall , i feel this is the best laptop i ' ve ever purchased or used .####[('laptop', 'best')]
regardless to the fact that the outside box was damaged , the inside box was fine .####[('outside box', 'damaged'), ('inside box', 'fine')]
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####[('apps', 'drawback')]
i predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 ( frostbyte 3 engine ) that this machine will perform well with the impending starwars battlefront ( also frostbyte 3 ) .####[('machine', 'well')]

this is a great computer .####[('computer', 'great')]
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####[('device', 'poorly'), ('device', 'good')]
lo and behold , i hadn ' t read quite all of the 1 * reviews : the worst was a teacher who had ordered so many for her several classes and said ` ` i think the problem is with the motherboard .####[('motherboard', 'worst')]
needless to say , android / play rollout is being managed very , very poorly .####[('android / play rollout', 'poorly')]
the build quality is fantastic .####[('build quality', 'fantastic')]

• bright screen with good colors####[('screen', 'bright'), ('screen', 'good')]

i hate to knock acer as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new product and then not being able to turn it on to use it .####[('product', 'frustrating')]
