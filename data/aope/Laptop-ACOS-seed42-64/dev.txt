things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####[('toshiba', 'better'), ('screen', 'nicer'), ('build quality', 'less impressive')]

the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####[('native chrome os media player', 'frustrated')]
