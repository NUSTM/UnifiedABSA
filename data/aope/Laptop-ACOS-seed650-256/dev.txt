this unit is ` ` pretty ` ` and stylish , so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason .####[('unit', 'stylish'), ('unit', 'pretty')]
this version has been my least favorite version i ' ve had for the following reasons listed bellow the pros .####[('version', 'least favorite')]
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####[('track pad', 'disappointment')]
but do not dare will only be good for playing games maybe it will get better .####[('it', 'good')]
asus customer support was through chat and cumbersome .####[('asus customer support', 'cumbersome')]
the screen is very dim however .####[('screen', 'dim')]
sounds like a good deal for a $ 620 laptop but battery doesn ' t perform as promised i am hardly getting 4 hrs .####[('laptop', 'good')]
screen is good .####[('screen', 'good')]
keyboard is decent with good travel .####[('keyboard', 'good'), ('keyboard', 'decent')]
thin bezels allow for a compact frame####[('bezels', 'thin')]
overall this is a good system for the price and i do recommend the ssd for the price .####[('system', 'good'), ('ssd', 'recommend')]
but my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises , both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk .####[('fan', 'concerns')]
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####[('machines', 'amazing'), ('asus', 'loved')]
if you can save for 750 - 800 i would recommend going up a bit in the asus line .####[('asus', 'recommend')]
this computer is loud !####[('computer', 'loud')]
acer made a winner here !####[('acer', 'winner')]
buy this computer and you ' ll be very happy with it .####[('computer', 'happy')]
+ backlight kb and travel feels pretty nice on the keys .####[('backlight kb', 'nice'), ('keys', 'nice')]
the ports were another thing that i was really excited to see fully included on a laptop in this price range .####[('ports', 'excited')]
i ' ve been happy being able to plug in and run overwatch from time to time on this laptop , with higher settings .####[('laptop', 'happy')]
this is the best laptop for the price .####[('laptop', 'best')]
i like that it ' s got the 8th generation i5 cpu .####[('8th generation i5 cpu', 'like')]
dedicated graphics card####[('graphics card', 'dedicated')]
the picture clarity is amazing and the backlit keyboard is awesome .####[('picture clarity', 'amazing'), ('backlit keyboard', 'awesome')]
also love that access to the hd / ssd and ram slots is really easy .####[('hd / ssd', 'love'), ('ram slots', 'easy')]
- the battery life is excellent ( i get 6 - 8 hours of normal university student usage out of it ) and even when i ' m using it , it charges as fast as my phone .####[('battery life', 'fast'), ('battery life', 'excellent')]
the chromebook has instant connection and a hugely impressive 8 - hour battery life when left on .####[('battery life', 'impressive')]
a great chromebook at a very reasonable price , includes the google play store .####[('chromebook', 'great'), ('chromebook', 'reasonable')]
very easy to set up .####[('set up', 'easy')]
the chromebook was packaged well and we saw no defects ( ours was used ) .####[('chromebook', 'well'), ('chromebook', 'no defects')]
it is a basic little laptop and i love it .####[('laptop', 'love')]
a good product !####[('product', 'good')]
light thin best price power laptop####[('laptop', 'best'), ('laptop', 'light'), ('laptop', 'thin')]
i ' m using it mainly to store movies , and the 1 tb drive is nice .####[('drive', 'nice')]
nice keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'nice')]
i have always loved loved the kindles .####[('kindles', 'loved')]
my only complaint is that the mouse keypad is a little big .####[('mouse keypad', 'big'), ('mouse keypad', 'complaint')]
only thing i really didn ' t like about this was how quickly the battery drained .####[('battery', "' t like")]
if you ' re big on aesthetics then you ' ll love the look .####[('look', 'love')]
just a home pc laptop that works very well .####[('home pc laptop', 'well')]
it has a full size keyboard , a number pad , a camera , and great big screen !####[('screen', 'big'), ('screen', 'great')]
very happy with this laptop although not a fan of windows 10 .####[('laptop', 'happy')]
navigates well .####[('navigates', 'well')]
which is really sad because in the time i could actually use the chromebook i absolutely loved it .####[('chromebook', 'sad'), ('chromebook', 'loved')]
many apps aren ' t ` ` compatible ` ` and even the ones that work , they look awful .####[('apps', 'awful')]
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####[('toshiba', 'better'), ('screen', 'nicer'), ('build quality', 'less impressive')]
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####[('device', 'exaggerating')]
for home users , these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two - screening , to watching videos and calling family .####[('machines', 'cheap')]
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####[('processor', 'best')]
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####[('chromebook', 'negligible')]
i also don ' t want the power cord draped down the right side and annoying me .####[('power cord', 'annoying')]
i was extremely hesitant to buy a used macbook pro ( it ' s still a lot of money ) but so far am surprisingly pleased with it .####[('macbook pro', 'pleased'), ('macbook pro', 'hesitant')]
- new ports that were not in the 2011 model : hdmi port , extra thunderbolt video port ( now it has two instead of one )####[('ports', 'new')]
i had the chance to test the new radeon graphics card and it ' s really good .####[('radeon graphics card', 'good')]
these macbook pro computers are expensive .####[('macbook pro computers', 'expensive')]
i love the retina display .####[('retina display', 'love')]
i am extremely happy with this laptop .####[('laptop', 'happy')]
great product !####[('product', 'great')]
battery issues aside , i really love this laptop and it is easily the nicest piece of electronics i have ever owned .####[('laptop', 'love')]
neat and sleek build , great display and very nice os####[('os', 'nice'), ('build', 'neat'), ('build', 'sleek'), ('display', 'great')]
the retina screen is amazing .####[('retina screen', 'amazing')]
less of a fault of the much lauded diving board and more a factor of the very well designed new hardware .####[('hardware', 'well')]
not to mention , the touchbar is just another gimmicky addition to the ` ` future of apple ` ` ( really not as effective as one would think ) .####[('touchbar', 'gimmicky')]
such a nice mac####[('mac', 'nice')]
price was very good and met my expectations also shipping was very quick .####[('shipping', 'quick')]
my first mac is awesome !####[('mac', 'awesome')]
as i bought 13 inch model , it is very portable .####[('model', 'portable')]
i ' ve been extremely impressed by this device .####[('device', 'impressed')]
the only drawback is that it only comes with 32 gb of hard drive .####[('hard drive', 'drawback')]
configuring the printer was a little tricky but not bad .####[('printer', 'not bad')]
my desktop runs all my video editing software for my bigger and most demanding projects and mylaptop is great for editing video and running pc games in places other than my home ( like school ! )####[('mylaptop', 'great')]
this is where the r11 gets interesting .####[('r11', 'interesting')]
i have had it about 4 days and have been checking out how well it runs my favorite android apps .####[('android apps', 'favorite')]
unfortunately , this particular computer is 100 % unusable after only 2 years and 2 weeks .####[('computer', 'unusable')]
it is a timeless design and a very respectable screen .####[('screen', 'respectable'), ('design', 'timeless')]
* extremely weak graphics card .####[('graphics card', 'weak')]
the intel iris sucks .####[('intel iris', 'sucks')]
now i ' m just down to some gripes that are probably here to stay : the bluetooth on this thing is really fussy , the non - functional video output ( using usb - c video out through an hdmi cable sends just a blank desktop background and no audio , even if i am playing a movie or youtube visibly on the c302 screen ) , and that it can ' t hold a vpn connection without dropping it every 20 - 30 minutes .####[('bluetooth', 'fussy')]
- good screen .####[('screen', 'good')]
the funny part is that the customer service people have been great but they have no control to take care of problems .####[('customer service', 'great')]
all metal body , very slim form factor , and has a pretty decent touchscreen .####[('factor', 'slim'), ('touchscreen', 'decent')]
anyhow , within a week , the speakers started crackling annoyingly when watching videos , or playing games .####[('speakers', 'annoyingly')]
the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####[('native chrome os media player', 'frustrated')]
it also had charging problems and got terrible warranty support .####[('warranty support', 'terrible')]
i feel like i bought a decent machine but it ' s unable to handle the ram workload .####[('machine', 'decent')]
don ' t get me wrong , the device flips back and forth very well .####[('device', 'well')]
this computer is really hard to use .####[('computer', 'hard')]
other than this , it ' s a decent product .####[('product', 'decent')]
the machine ' s visible design itself was fine .####[('machine', 'fine')]
i really liked it when i first got it , it performs very well and the software is very easy to use .####[('software', 'easy')]
first , the factory default driver configuration of this thing is unstable , which makes installing a correct configuration more difficult .####[('factory default driver', 'unstable'), ('factory default driver', 'difficult')]
the mouse pad is very touchy , but i use a separate bluetooth mouse anyways .####[('mouse pad', 'touchy')]
i didn ' t even call for tech help because a brand new laptop should not be giving me such a headache .####[('brand new laptop', 'headache')]
monitor screen is ok , sometimes the contrast is poor but looks better in games .####[('monitor screen', 'ok'), ('contrast', 'better'), ('contrast', 'poor')]
i would * not * recommend this laptop .####[('laptop', '* not * recommend')]
the overall material the laptop is made of feels incredibly cheap .####[('overall material the laptop', 'cheap')]
don ' t waste your money on this computer , it will disapoint you in every way possible .####[('computer', 'disapoint')]
the laptop was dead on arrival .####[('laptop', 'dead')]
i have had this laptop two months now and it has crashed as many times .####[('laptop', 'crashed')]
this is the worst laptop i have ever bought in my entire life .####[('laptop', 'worst')]
battery charger is super tiny and lightweight , which is an additional advantage vs the 1 lb brick that you have to lug around with the ux501vw .####[('battery charger', 'tiny'), ('battery charger', 'lightweight')]
other than that its components are actually very good .####[('components', 'good')]
the screen looks amazing , ips it seems .####[('screen', 'amazing')]
loving the laptop .####[('laptop', 'loving')]
it ' s light weight , sleek , the screen resolution is great and it runs very well for everyday use .####[('screen resolution', 'great')]
i got this laptop for school and it is simply amazing .####[('laptop', 'amazing')]
moreover , the 8th gen i5 cpu is amazing .####[('8th gen i5 cpu', 'amazing')]
this has been a very light convenient laptop for me .####[('laptop', 'convenient'), ('laptop', 'light')]
i have no issues with using the internal hard drive , it works fast enough for me when loading up my software and music .####[('internal hard drive', 'fast')]
i ' m not a computer nerd but for a joe punch clock this is nice####[('this', 'nice')]
love the form factor and the light weight as i often use my laptop while laying down .####[('my laptop', 'light'), ('my laptop', 'love')]
less than that , for me , the screen looks dull .####[('screen', 'dull')]
if you ' re mainly on youtube or reading stuff online , this chromebook functions well for that purpose .####[('chromebook', 'well')]
looks like the hdmi port may be defective or something - - another reviewer had a similar problem .####[('hdmi port', 'defective')]
before the review this package has nice presentation and solid build .####[('package', 'nice'), ('build', 'solid')]
( good ) as for the laptop ( when it worked , and i mean for the whole 30 minutes ) it was extremely fast .####[('laptop', 'good'), ('laptop', 'fast')]
adequate screen .####[('screen', 'adequate')]
the product looks reasonable at this price range .####[('product', 'reasonable')]
i ' ve only had the computer for a little over a month , that is annoying on many levels .####[('computer', 'annoying')]
i ' m extremely disappointed with the performance of this laptop .####[('laptop', 'disappointed')]
- sleek and nice texture on lid####[('lid', 'nice'), ('lid', 'sleek')]
one of the keys is especially flimsy and feels like it could break at any moment .####[('one of the keys', 'flimsy')]
machine is totally unusable during the update .####[('machine', 'unusable')]
gamers , do not fool yourself with the fancy ` ` intel i5 , 8th generation ` ` , nothing can fix an incompetent hard drive , that 8gb ram is worth nothing .####[('hard drive', 'incompetent'), ('intel i5', 'fancy'), ('ram', 'worth nothing')]
a big part of this device is its gorgeous aesthetic .####[('device', 'aesthetic'), ('device', 'gorgeous')]
this is a great device and the $ 450 asking price seems fair .####[('device', 'fair'), ('device', 'great')]
i ' m usually peaked with ram ( ~ 95 % ) which is good because it ' s better used than not used .####[('ram', 'better'), ('ram', 'good')]
quality is excellent so far , and the software / hardware combination works like they were made for each other ( which is what you want : ) )####[('quality', 'excellent')]
after a week of use , i can safely say it is the most impressive chromebook i have used to - date .####[('chromebook', 'impressive')]
love this chromebook !####[('chromebook', 'love')]
love the backlit keyboard .####[('backlit keyboard', 'love')]
at least the volume through bluetooth was tolerable .####[('volume through bluetooth', 'tolerable')]
after two years , or almost , the worst thing about this machine is lack of printer support .####[('machine', 'worst')]
setup was fast and easy , but then again i ' ve been a gmail / gcal / gdocs purist for a while now .####[('setup', 'easy'), ('setup', 'fast')]
in general , it has the look and feel of a premium laptop that is at home in any situation such as sitting down with a client .####[('laptop', 'premium')]
battery life is outstanding .####[('battery life', 'outstanding')]
this is my third chromebook and easily the best i ' ve encountered .####[('chromebook', 'best')]
it ' s lighter , good construction , chromebook works perfectly and downloaded 10 different apps i normally use for free .####[('chromebook', 'perfectly'), ('construction', 'good')]
battery life is also solid .####[('battery life', 'solid')]
construction looks and feels great .####[('construction', 'great')]
nice screen .####[('screen', 'nice')]
i am a mac person in every other way , but i love this chromebook !####[('chromebook', 'love')]
easy set up , nice picture , responsive mouse pad , very lightweight , etc .####[('set up', 'easy'), ('mouse pad', 'responsive')]
i love the keyboard , trackpad and screen .####[('trackpad', 'love'), ('keyboard', 'love'), ('screen', 'love')]
the speakers are super clear and get loud enough , but obviously lack bass .####[('speakers', 'clear'), ('speakers', 'loud')]
the build quality seems very good .####[('build quality', 'good')]
for ~ $ 400 , i ' m happy with this product after a couple months .####[('product', 'happy')]
it ' s fast and the screen is nice .####[('screen', 'nice')]
overall i like its slim design and feather light - weight alone with well equipped spec that can meet my daily work environment .####[('design', 'light - weight'), ('design', 'slim'), ('design', 'like'), ('spec', 'well')]
i ' m four months into owning this lean , mean , little machine .####[('machine', 'mean'), ('machine', 'lean')]
