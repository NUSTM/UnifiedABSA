if you are wanting a beautiful screen that beats all other tablets for color range and matches samsung ' s galaxy tab s3 ( top android tablet ) , but if you absolutely must have a keyboard , don ' t buy this .####[('screen', 'beautiful')]
to make things worse , i currently live overseas and am highly doubtful that samsung would do anything about this , given that it was bought in the us .####[('samsung', 'doubtful')]
in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this product given the obvious history of quality control issues .####[('product', 'cautious')]
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####[('device', 'worth')]
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####[('keyboard', 'bad')]
this is quite honest , a very expensive chrome browser .####[('chrome browser', 'expensive')]
first occasionally and later to a point where the laptop became unusable .####[('laptop', 'unusable')]

the only thing i did not like about the design is the fact that the speakers are on the bottom of the unit .####[('speakers', 'not like')]
with real function keys , i don ' t worry about one vendor or another not upgrading fast enough and losing virtual function keys , so this model is golden .####[('model', 'golden')]
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .####[('trackpad', 'best')]
the overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold .####[('design', 'sleek'), ('design', 'pleasing')]
the force touch trackpad works great .####[('force touch trackpad', 'great')]
and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .####[('system', 'not worry')]
fantastic computer !####[('computer', 'fantastic')]
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####[('apps', 'drawback')]
but the mac looked and worked great .####[('mac', 'great')]
it boots up instantaneously .####[('boots up', 'instantaneously')]
it is a small , light , powerful device that until 2016 seemed custom fit for content creators , photographers , and other such lines of work or hobbies .####[('device', 'light'), ('device', 'powerful'), ('device', 'small')]

i was super worried that touching the keyboard when it was in tablet mode would cause it to switch back to laptop mode , but it looks like once you move the screen back past like 180 degrees , it goes into full touchscreen .####[('keyboard', 'worried')]
i also bought a wireless mouse , which paired perfectly .####[('wireless mouse', 'perfectly')]
well , i have to say , i ' m fairly impressed with my new chrome flipbook !####[('chrome flipbook', 'impressed')]
i chose this one mainly because of the full size keyboard , larger screen , and full size hdmi .####[('screen', 'larger')]
although 4 gigs of ram doesn ' t seem like a lot to some of us , because of the simple software , it is very fast with no lag .####[('software', 'simple')]
the power button is no longer on the keyboard , but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine .####[('power button', 'fine')]
this machine , through her minimum time of using it , has already been so much faster for her to use .####[('machine', 'faster')]

this model has a defect .####[('model', 'defect')]
the laptop is in great physical conditions , no scratches or anything , but certain actions run slowly , specifically any file read or write , like copying a document , uploading an image , creating a new file , etc .####[('laptop', 'great'), ('laptop', 'slowly')]
unfortunately this macbook is part of the ` ` staingate ` ` series , i would not suggest to buy this as apple doesn ' t seem to care about customers buying a faulty product that is very expensive####[('product', 'faulty'), ('product', 'expensive')]
great aesthetics .####[('aesthetics', 'great')]
transferring files from a non - iphone phone , like android is extremely annoying .####[('android', 'annoying')]

i love how i can charge my laptop on both sides of the device .####[('laptop', 'love'), ('device', 'love')]

its a good computer for the price but it needs to work awhile without crashing within 6 months .####[('computer', 'good')]
at this point i no longer trusted this model and was afraid of having the same issue with a replacement if i exchanged it , and then not having enough time to do another exchange and still be able to charge and configure it in time to wrap and put under the christmas tree for my son , so i contacted amazon and they gladly e - mailed me a return shipping label and refunded my money in full in 3 days , after receiving it back from me .####[('model', 'afraid'), ('amazon', 'gladly')]
i hate to knock acer as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new product and then not being able to turn it on to use it .####[('product', 'frustrating')]
