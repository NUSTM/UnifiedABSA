it is also amazingly quiet : the ssd doesn ' t make any noise , and the fan only spins up if i am doing something intensive like playing games or running a heafty program - just browsing or watching videos / basic office work will not make this computer more than whisper .####('ssd', 'positive')
additionally , this has a nice backlight to the keyboard , which will turn off when nothing has been pressed for about 20 seconds ( great for when just watching or reading something ) or can be manually turned off entirely .####('keyboard', 'positive')
in addition , you are gifted with an sd card reader and an optical drive which can read and write cds and dvds ( which i can ' t say i ' ve used other than testing that it worked , but i do remember how hazardous it is to suddenly need something like that and not have it available ) .####('optical drive', 'positive')

the screen is more than sufficient for non - gaming , business use , and it seems as fast as expected .####('screen', 'positive')
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####('ssd', 'positive')
