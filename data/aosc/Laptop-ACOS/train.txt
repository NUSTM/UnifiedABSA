i am terribly disappointed with obviously a poor qc by samsung .####('qc', 'negative')
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .####('screen', 'negative')
returning it into a standard laptop position did not help , the screen actually turned dark and only closing and opening the lid helped return it to normal state .####('screen', 'negative')
to make things worse , i currently live overseas and am highly doubtful that samsung would do anything about this , given that it was bought in the us .####('samsung', 'negative')
no matter where on earth , you can get your apple product repaired .####('apple product', 'positive')
in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this product given the obvious history of quality control issues .####('product', 'negative')
wanting something maybe a pinch faster , but more importantly , a flippy touchscreen with google play support .####('touchscreen', 'positive')
first and foremost , lets talk about the infamous keyboard .####('keyboard', 'negative')
i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of keyboards and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .####('keyboards', 'negative')
i ' ll give the chromebook pro an extra star for its best asset , the screen .####('screen', 'positive')
it ' s also worth noting my unit came with a floating trackpad , with initial play before the actually click .####('trackpad', 'negative')
if you are indifferent about the screen , do not buy this !####('screen', 'positive')
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####('chromebook', 'negative')
there is a power button on the side which i have accidentally hit quite a few times .####('power button', 'negative')
i haven ' t abused this at all , and i noticed a small crack in the screen today and it ' s starting to spider out .####('screen', 'negative')
so $ 500 bucks down the drain as i ' m sure that isn ' t covered by any warranties .####('warranties', 'negative')
with it being a touch screen it surprised me that it cracked and i have no idea how .####('touch screen', 'negative')
my screen stayed black more than it was on .####('screen', 'negative')

i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####('device', 'negative')
it is very limited and the competition for an actual usable operating system that can do a lot more than just browse the internet , are available .####('operating system', 'negative')
the quality is is meh .####('the quality', 'negative')
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####('keyboard', 'negative')
it simply feels like a cheap samsung tablet with a keyboard attached .####('samsung tablet', 'negative')
the playstore its immature .####('playstore', 'negative')
their designs are made for phones and on this huge screen , they are palpitated .####('designs', 'negative')
this is quite honest , a very expensive chrome browser .####('chrome browser', 'negative')

after a couple of weeks i started experiencing web browsing issues .####('web browsing', 'negative')
first occasionally and later to a point where the laptop became unusable .####('laptop', 'negative')
after some googling i realized that the wifi issue was related to bluetooth being on .####('wifi', 'negative')
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####('stylus', 'negative')
10 minutes after finishing this review started having a new issue : touch pad started acting out .####('touch pad', 'negative')
you know , i wanted to love this machine .####('machine', 'neutral')
i went in to this purchase assuming that the availability of android apps from the google play store would make this unit into a true windows alternative .####('android apps', 'negative')
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .####('keyboard', 'negative')
' what a bunch of whiners , ' i concluded about all the people who slammed the keyboard .####('keyboard', 'negative')
so one star off for the keyboard .####('keyboard', 'negative')
none of their android versions were what i would call usable .####('android versions', 'negative')
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .####('display', 'positive')
unfortunately , my chromebook that i purchased through best buy was dead on arrival .####('chromebook', 'negative')

reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .####('touch screen', 'negative')
also the case design is sort of rounded at both sides - a minor issue but it makes the device pop open in my purse and detracts from the ` ` feel ` ` of the device by making it feel a lot thicker than it actually is .####('case', 'negative')

virtually every single app for it is compromised in some manner .####('app', 'negative')

chrome os is not matured in any way .####('chrome os', 'negative')
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####('chromeos', 'negative')
google is very concerned about arc to chromeos connections for security , etc etc .####('google', 'neutral')
the rub is that chromeos itself is so limited in functionality that it is probably the most secure os platform out there .####('chromeos', 'negative')
apps are glitchy .####('apps', 'negative')

the only real upgrade for the new one , before adding on options is faster memory .####('memory', 'positive')
i run windows and linux vms fairly regularly and while i could run them on a comparable windows system , adding windows systems to an already portly windows system has never worked out well for me , so while disappointed in the new upgrades , this 2015 model still rocks vms and does all i need it too for far less $ $ $ .####('the new upgrades', 'negative')

the current model only has two , which can be problematic if you hook up an external hard drive and an external bluray drive ( which requires two ports ) at the same time .####('model', 'negative')
sure , another generation back was arguably better , but i find this computer to be adequate to my needs right now ( though it is a disappointment that i can ' t upgrade the ram , which definitely limits the lifetime of how long this product will last ) .####('computer', 'neutral')

i think the mbp ticks off more of the nice - to - have boxes for me than the xps13 overall .####('mbp', 'positive')
the mbp does not run as hot as my old white mb did .####('mbp', 'neutral')
the battery life is really pretty comparable ( slightly more with the mbp , and i can obtain info on app energy usage a bit easier imo ) .####('battery life', 'positive')
the trackpad is the ultimate difference - maker for me .####('trackpad', 'neutral')
the mbp trackpad is best in class and if you are not using a mouse , this makes a huge difference .####('mbp trackpad', 'positive')
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####('apps', 'negative')
