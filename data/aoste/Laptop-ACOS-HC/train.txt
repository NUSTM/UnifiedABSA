the battery life sucks as it starts to die after 3 - 4 hours of use ( no gaming ) .####[('battery life', 'negative', 'sucks')]
lastly , the touch pad , even after lowering the sensitivity , it ' s still pretty sensitive and the click pads are stiff , so it doesn ' t tap on clicks , sometimes i have to click on it hard enough , so that ' s a bit annoying .####[('touch pad', 'negative', 'annoying')]
only con would be that display is not that bright , although i would say at the brightest setting is probably where it should be .####[('display', 'negative', 'con')]

this device ( and its brother the plus ) has a grave hardware flaw that causes the touchscreen to move on its own .####[('hardware', 'negative', 'flaw')]
samsung has not been helpful in getting this fixed .####[('samsung', 'negative', 'not been helpful')]
it makes the entire device unusable .####[('device', 'negative', 'unusable')]
i like everything about the device , but the beautiful touchscreen ended up malfunctioning about 6 - months after purchase .####[('device', 'positive', 'like'), ('touchscreen', 'positive', 'beautiful')]

if you are wanting a beautiful screen that beats all other tablets for color range and matches samsung ' s galaxy tab s3 ( top android tablet ) , but if you absolutely must have a keyboard , don ' t buy this .####[('screen', 'positive', 'beautiful')]
i am terribly disappointed with obviously a poor qc by samsung .####[('qc', 'negative', 'poor'), ('qc', 'negative', 'disappointed')]
to make things worse , i currently live overseas and am highly doubtful that samsung would do anything about this , given that it was bought in the us .####[('samsung', 'negative', 'doubtful')]
in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this product given the obvious history of quality control issues .####[('product', 'negative', 'cautious')]
first and foremost , lets talk about the infamous keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'negative', 'infamous')]
i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of keyboards and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .####[('keyboards', 'negative', 'worst')]
i ' ll give the chromebook pro an extra star for its best asset , the screen .####[('screen', 'positive', 'best')]
with it being a touch screen it surprised me that it cracked and i have no idea how .####[('touch screen', 'negative', 'surprised')]

awesome display .####[('display', 'positive', 'awesome')]
fast boot and reliable os .####[('boot', 'positive', 'reliable'), ('boot', 'positive', 'fast'), ('os', 'positive', 'fast'), ('os', 'positive', 'reliable')]
chassis could be studier and keyboard and trackpad very average and lack of backlight is a deal breaker for me .####[('keyboard', 'neutral', 'average'), ('trackpad', 'neutral', 'average')]
mouse track pad is non standard .####[('mouse track pad', 'negative', 'non standard')]
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####[('device', 'negative', 'worth')]
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####[('keyboard', 'negative', 'bad')]
it simply feels like a cheap samsung tablet with a keyboard attached .####[('samsung tablet', 'negative', 'cheap')]
the playstore its immature .####[('playstore', 'negative', 'immature')]
this is quite honest , a very expensive chrome browser .####[('chrome browser', 'negative', 'expensive')]
first occasionally and later to a point where the laptop became unusable .####[('laptop', 'negative', 'unusable')]
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####[('stylus', 'negative', 'failed'), ('stylus', 'negative', 'stuck')]
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .####[('keyboard', 'negative', 'bad')]
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .####[('display', 'positive', 'nice')]
unfortunately , my chromebook that i purchased through best buy was dead on arrival .####[('chromebook', 'negative', 'dead')]
the cable functions just fine .####[('cable', 'neutral', 'fine')]
the chromebook is simply dead from what i can tell .####[('chromebook', 'negative', 'dead')]
as you can see , the cable is active , but the ` ` power led ` ` has never had any color .####[('cable', 'neutral', 'active')]
very disappointing , samsung !####[('samsung', 'negative', 'disappointing')]
i have also noticed the pro seems to run hotter and have a noticeably shorter battery life .####[('pro', 'negative', 'hotter'), ('battery life', 'negative', 'shorter')]
horrible , purchased directly from google , dead pixel on arrival , note feature did not pick up stylus and bluetooth rarely worked .####[('pixel', 'negative', 'dead')]
samsung makes garbage and treats their customers with no respect .####[('samsung', 'negative', 'garbage')]
virtually every single app for it is compromised in some manner .####[('app', 'negative', 'compromised')]
apps are glitchy .####[('apps', 'negative', 'glitchy')]
samsung sent me a new stylus free of charge and free of hassle , which was nice of them because the top of the oem stylus popped off one day and could not be reassembled .####[('stylus', 'positive', 'nice')]
the touchpad doesn ' t have clickable function in the top right or top left corners which is becomes annoying for certain tasks .####[('touchpad', 'negative', 'annoying')]
many of acer ' s chromebooks have , historically , been hampered by their poor displays .####[('displays', 'negative', 'poor')]
the chromebook 14 has a 1080p ips display with fantastic viewing angles and excellent brightness .####[('display', 'positive', 'excellent'), ('display', 'positive', 'fantastic')]
it feels wonderful to finally say that about an acer display .####[('acer display', 'positive', 'wonderful')]
the extra ram , however , is great for everyone , as it makes this device more capable of running many tabs , or handling higher demand tasks like streaming content , without tabs crashing out or caching / reloading .####[('ram', 'positive', 'great')]
the screen is great , for both media consumption and general computing / web browsing ; it offers a nice amount of local storage and solid performance via the intel processor and 4gb of ram , and it looks sharp , thanks to modern design queues and aluminum build materials .####[('storage', 'positive', 'nice'), ('screen', 'positive', 'great'), ('intel processor', 'positive', 'solid')]
the acer is very nice , to be sure , especially considering the price or $ 299 .####[('acer', 'positive', 'nice')]
it also has pretty decent i / o with two usb 3 .####[('i / o', 'positive', 'decent')]
i can ' t help but feel that people are also slightly exaggerating the performance offered by the n3160 .####[('n3160', 'negative', 'exaggerating')]
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####[('acer chromebook 14', 'positive', 'excellent')]
5 years old or matched by chromebooks at half the price , the absence of a touchscreen upgrade , or the use of slower emmc storage instead of a real m .####[('emmc storage', 'negative', 'slower')]
even the touchpad and keyboard perform as well as the very best chromebooks currently available .####[('touchpad', 'positive', 'best'), ('keyboard', 'positive', 'best')]
anything that runs in a chrome browser on a desktop or laptop will run on a chromebook , and there are novel app - like extensions for almost anything else ( calculator apps , command lines , etc . )####[('app - like extensions', 'positive', 'novel')]
from the camera and audio quality through to the build styling , every aspect of this pc has been meticulously considered and it represents the best chromebook that has been delivered to date####[('chromebook', 'positive', 'best')]

the keyboard gives a satisfying audible response to being used , and the mouse is nice .####[('keyboard', 'positive', 'satisfying'), ('mouse', 'positive', 'nice')]
it ' s great in many ways ; the build is solid , the screen is good ( and the resolution is insane ) , and the keyboard is decent , though only time will tell if it ' s as diet coke - resistant as the samsung ' s keys are .####[('screen', 'positive', 'good'), ('build', 'positive', 'solid'), ('keyboard', 'positive', 'decent'), ('resolution', 'positive', 'insane')]
more importantly i appreciate the uncanny speed to boot up or wake up .####[('speed', 'positive', 'appreciate')]

this chromebook is easy to use , boot up quickly but it does occasionally crash and a push of the on / off button will quickly reset it .####[('chromebook', 'positive', 'easy'), ('boot up', 'positive', 'quickly')]
the chromebook is quite ideal for those who use their computer mostly for surfing the internet .####[('chromebook', 'positive', 'ideal')]
as for actual device it is completely gorgeous and ( now ) works flawlessly .####[('device', 'positive', 'gorgeous'), ('device', 'positive', 'flawlessly')]
he was ecstatic at the power , the screen , the layout - pretty much everything .####[('screen', 'positive', 'ecstatic'), ('power', 'positive', 'ecstatic')]

the only thing i did not like about the design is the fact that the speakers are on the bottom of the unit .####[('speakers', 'negative', 'not like')]
the only real upgrade for the new one , before adding on options is faster memory .####[('memory', 'positive', 'faster')]
i run windows and linux vms fairly regularly and while i could run them on a comparable windows system , adding windows systems to an already portly windows system has never worked out well for me , so while disappointed in the new upgrades , this 2015 model still rocks vms and does all i need it too for far less $ $ $ .####[('the new upgrades', 'negative', 'disappointed')]
while usb - c is cool , a bag full of dongles is not .####[('usb - c', 'positive', 'cool')]
with real function keys , i don ' t worry about one vendor or another not upgrading fast enough and losing virtual function keys , so this model is golden .####[('model', 'positive', 'golden')]

i ' m okay with that given that the body is thinner .####[('body', 'positive', 'thinner')]

the display is fantastic on this laptop .####[('display', 'positive', 'fantastic')]
the keyboard is ok .####[('keyboard', 'neutral', 'ok')]
other than that , the key sizes are good and the backlighting works just fine .####[('backlighting', 'positive', 'fine'), ('key', 'positive', 'good')]
the trackpad has gotten better with this new model .####[('trackpad', 'positive', 'better')]
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .####[('trackpad', 'positive', 'best')]
apps open instantly and the ac wifi performance is very nice .####[('apps', 'positive', 'instantly'), ('ac wifi', 'positive', 'nice')]
i ' m not sure when this feature was introduced , but it is very welcome .####[('feature', 'positive', 'welcome')]
the os is easy to use , the app store lacks many apps that i use , so i have to go directly to the developers site to download them .####[('os', 'positive', 'easy')]
i have not messed with the continuity feature much , but it is nice having the favorites and open tabs sync from my laptop to my iphone .####[('continuity feature', 'positive', 'favorites'), ('continuity feature', 'positive', 'nice')]
the current model only has two , which can be problematic if you hook up an external hard drive and an external bluray drive ( which requires two ports ) at the same time .####[('model', 'negative', 'problematic')]
it ' s nice and lightweight , the sd port is useful , and it ' s powerful enough for me to do fairly layer intensive graphic design work in photoshop and basic grading in lightroom .####[('sd port', 'positive', 'useful')]
the keys feel fantastic to type on .####[('keys', 'positive', 'fantastic')]
the overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold .####[('design', 'positive', 'sleek'), ('design', 'positive', 'pleasing')]

the battery life is really pretty comparable ( slightly more with the mbp , and i can obtain info on app energy usage a bit easier imo ) .####[('battery life', 'positive', 'comparable')]
the mbp trackpad is best in class and if you are not using a mouse , this makes a huge difference .####[('mbp trackpad', 'positive', 'best')]
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####[('apps', 'negative', 'drawback')]
an unexpected benefit for me has been the iphone / mbp integration .####[('iphone / mbp integration', 'positive', 'benefit')]
i love the airdrop and receiving imessages on my mbp ( although it can cut into productivity if you ' re not careful ) .####[('airdrop', 'positive', 'love')]

as far as gaming performance , the m370x does quite well .####[('m370x', 'positive', 'well')]
i predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 ( frostbyte 3 engine ) that this machine will perform well with the impending starwars battlefront ( also frostbyte 3 ) .####[('machine', 'positive', 'well')]
with the windows 10 / directx 12 improvements , frostbite 3 games will do very well on this machine at 1050p graphics / medium / low with the new starwars game .####[('machine', 'positive', 'well')]

the screen is pleasantly satisfying with the touch screen and foldability .####[('screen', 'positive', 'pleasantly'), ('screen', 'positive', 'satisfying')]
the power button is no longer on the keyboard , but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine .####[('power button', 'positive', 'fine')]

however there are many issues with this computer on start up that really bothered me and made my experience with a mac not that great####[('computer', 'negative', 'bothered'), ('mac', 'negative', 'not that great')]
i had this laptop for a little over a year and it worked well at first .####[('laptop', 'positive', 'well')]
unfortunately this macbook is part of the ` ` staingate ` ` series , i would not suggest to buy this as apple doesn ' t seem to care about customers buying a faulty product that is very expensive####[('product', 'negative', 'faulty'), ('product', 'negative', 'expensive')]
the machine looks amazing doesn ' t it !####[('machine', 'positive', 'amazing')]
apple should ashamed to be associated with this cheap , lousy , clearly inferior , plastic nightmare - but then again , maybe that is exactly what they do want , so profits soar .####[('apple', 'negative', 'ashamed')]
apple used to make a wonderful product but my computer is now a useless paperweight until i have a new charger sent to me .####[('apple', 'negative', 'wonderful'), ('computer', 'negative', 'useless')]

overpriced low quality product .####[('product', 'negative', 'overpriced'), ('product', 'negative', 'low')]

* very weak wifi reception from the built - in antenna .####[('wifi', 'negative', 'weak')]
the machine is near - unusable out of the box .####[('machine', 'negative', 'unusable')]
you have to ` ` increase contrast ` ` and ` ` reduce transparency ` ` in the accessibility options to make it perform ok , but with a ui that looks like s * * * .####[('ui', 'negative', 's * * *')]
sadly , apple is moving into fashion - - your laptop is no longer a performing athlete .####[('apple', 'negative', 'sadly')]

the stock video player misses audio on a lot of movies , and using the vlc app ( android ) is super buggy ( frequently freezes and shuts down ) .####[('vlc app', 'negative', 'buggy')]

i ' m still loving the * idea * of what the c302 is supposed to be , but the execution is feeling more and more of a miss .####[('c302', 'positive', 'loving')]
