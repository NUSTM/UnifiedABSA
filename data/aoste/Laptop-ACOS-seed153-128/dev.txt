this unit is ` ` pretty ` ` and stylish , so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason .####[('unit', 'positive', 'stylish'), ('unit', 'positive', 'pretty')]
this version has been my least favorite version i ' ve had for the following reasons listed bellow the pros .####[('version', 'negative', 'least favorite')]
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####[('track pad', 'negative', 'disappointment')]
after about 5 / 10 minutes of use the screen goes crazy and you have to force to power down and wait to restart .####[('screen', 'negative', 'crazy')]
the screen is very dim however .####[('screen', 'negative', 'dim')]
the brand new vivobook is dead in the water !####[('vivobook', 'negative', 'dead')]
screen is amazing####[('screen', 'positive', 'amazing')]
overall this is a good system for the price and i do recommend the ssd for the price .####[('system', 'positive', 'good'), ('ssd', 'positive', 'recommend')]
but my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises , both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk .####[('fan', 'negative', 'concerns')]
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####[('machines', 'positive', 'amazing'), ('asus', 'positive', 'loved')]
if you can save for 750 - 800 i would recommend going up a bit in the asus line .####[('asus', 'positive', 'recommend')]
it ' s pretty fast for a laptop especially a laptop in this price point .####[('laptop', 'positive', 'fast')]
the picture clarity is amazing and the backlit keyboard is awesome .####[('backlit keyboard', 'positive', 'awesome'), ('picture clarity', 'positive', 'amazing')]
- the battery life is excellent ( i get 6 - 8 hours of normal university student usage out of it ) and even when i ' m using it , it charges as fast as my phone .####[('battery life', 'positive', 'fast'), ('battery life', 'positive', 'excellent')]
the chromebook has instant connection and a hugely impressive 8 - hour battery life when left on .####[('battery life', 'positive', 'impressive')]
if you are in the google echo system , then this is great .####[('google echo system', 'positive', 'great')]
a good product !####[('product', 'positive', 'good')]
i ' m using it mainly to store movies , and the 1 tb drive is nice .####[('drive', 'positive', 'nice')]
nice keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'positive', 'nice')]
i have always loved loved the kindles .####[('kindles', 'positive', 'loved')]
my only complaint is that the mouse keypad is a little big .####[('mouse keypad', 'negative', 'complaint'), ('mouse keypad', 'negative', 'big')]
only thing i really didn ' t like about this was how quickly the battery drained .####[('battery', 'negative', "' t like")]
if you ' re big on aesthetics then you ' ll love the look .####[('look', 'positive', 'love')]
just a home pc laptop that works very well .####[('home pc laptop', 'positive', 'well')]
very happy with this laptop although not a fan of windows 10 .####[('laptop', 'positive', 'happy')]
which is really sad because in the time i could actually use the chromebook i absolutely loved it .####[('chromebook', 'negative', 'sad'), ('chromebook', 'positive', 'loved')]
many apps aren ' t ` ` compatible ` ` and even the ones that work , they look awful .####[('apps', 'negative', 'awful')]
another expensive & poorly executed samsung product .####[('samsung product', 'negative', 'poorly'), ('samsung product', 'negative', 'expensive')]
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####[('device', 'negative', 'exaggerating')]
for home users , these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two - screening , to watching videos and calling family .####[('machines', 'positive', 'cheap')]
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####[('processor', 'positive', 'best')]
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####[('chromebook', 'neutral', 'negligible')]
i was extremely hesitant to buy a used macbook pro ( it ' s still a lot of money ) but so far am surprisingly pleased with it .####[('macbook pro', 'positive', 'pleased'), ('macbook pro', 'neutral', 'hesitant')]
- new ports that were not in the 2011 model : hdmi port , extra thunderbolt video port ( now it has two instead of one )####[('ports', 'positive', 'new')]
these macbook pro computers are expensive .####[('macbook pro computers', 'negative', 'expensive')]
i am extremely happy with this laptop .####[('laptop', 'positive', 'happy')]
it doesn ' t effect any of the functionality , but it was a little disappointing to open the box to see a dent on something i ' d just spend $ 1 , 000 on .####[('dent', 'negative', 'disappointing')]
great product !####[('product', 'positive', 'great')]
the retina screen is amazing .####[('retina screen', 'positive', 'amazing')]
less of a fault of the much lauded diving board and more a factor of the very well designed new hardware .####[('hardware', 'positive', 'well')]
my first mac is awesome !####[('mac', 'positive', 'awesome')]
as i bought 13 inch model , it is very portable .####[('model', 'positive', 'portable')]
the only drawback is that it only comes with 32 gb of hard drive .####[('hard drive', 'negative', 'drawback')]
* extremely weak graphics card .####[('graphics card', 'negative', 'weak')]
now i ' m just down to some gripes that are probably here to stay : the bluetooth on this thing is really fussy , the non - functional video output ( using usb - c video out through an hdmi cable sends just a blank desktop background and no audio , even if i am playing a movie or youtube visibly on the c302 screen ) , and that it can ' t hold a vpn connection without dropping it every 20 - 30 minutes .####[('bluetooth', 'negative', 'fussy')]
the funny part is that the customer service people have been great but they have no control to take care of problems .####[('customer service', 'positive', 'great')]
anyhow , within a week , the speakers started crackling annoyingly when watching videos , or playing games .####[('speakers', 'negative', 'annoyingly')]
the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####[('native chrome os media player', 'negative', 'frustrated')]
it also had charging problems and got terrible warranty support .####[('warranty support', 'negative', 'terrible')]
games / video apps perform absolutely awfully .####[('games / video apps', 'negative', 'awfully')]
first , the factory default driver configuration of this thing is unstable , which makes installing a correct configuration more difficult .####[('factory default driver', 'negative', 'unstable'), ('factory default driver', 'negative', 'difficult')]
the mouse pad is very touchy , but i use a separate bluetooth mouse anyways .####[('mouse pad', 'neutral', 'touchy')]
the laptop its - self is great and is made of good build quality .####[('build quality', 'positive', 'good'), ('laptop', 'positive', 'great')]
beautiful screen .####[('screen', 'positive', 'beautiful')]
i have had this laptop two months now and it has crashed as many times .####[('laptop', 'negative', 'crashed')]
this laptop is small and thin for a 15 .####[('laptop', 'positive', 'thin'), ('laptop', 'positive', 'small')]
most of the laptop is actually very good , but is held back by a 5400 rpm hdd .####[('laptop', 'positive', 'good')]
the screen looks amazing , ips it seems .####[('screen', 'positive', 'amazing')]
loving the laptop .####[('laptop', 'positive', 'loving')]
it ' s light weight , sleek , the screen resolution is great and it runs very well for everyday use .####[('screen resolution', 'positive', 'great')]
love the form factor and the light weight as i often use my laptop while laying down .####[('my laptop', 'positive', 'light'), ('my laptop', 'positive', 'love')]
looks like the hdmi port may be defective or something - - another reviewer had a similar problem .####[('hdmi port', 'negative', 'defective')]
( good ) as for the laptop ( when it worked , and i mean for the whole 30 minutes ) it was extremely fast .####[('laptop', 'positive', 'good'), ('laptop', 'positive', 'fast')]
adequate screen .####[('screen', 'positive', 'adequate')]
one of the keys is especially flimsy and feels like it could break at any moment .####[('one of the keys', 'negative', 'flimsy')]
a big part of this device is its gorgeous aesthetic .####[('device', 'positive', 'aesthetic'), ('device', 'positive', 'gorgeous')]
this is a great device and the $ 450 asking price seems fair .####[('device', 'neutral', 'fair'), ('device', 'positive', 'great')]
quality is excellent so far , and the software / hardware combination works like they were made for each other ( which is what you want : ) )####[('quality', 'positive', 'excellent')]
love the backlit keyboard .####[('backlit keyboard', 'positive', 'love')]
at least the volume through bluetooth was tolerable .####[('volume through bluetooth', 'neutral', 'tolerable')]
after two years , or almost , the worst thing about this machine is lack of printer support .####[('machine', 'negative', 'worst')]
in general , it has the look and feel of a premium laptop that is at home in any situation such as sitting down with a client .####[('laptop', 'positive', 'premium')]
this is my third chromebook and easily the best i ' ve encountered .####[('chromebook', 'positive', 'best')]
battery life is also solid .####[('battery life', 'positive', 'solid')]
construction looks and feels great .####[('construction', 'positive', 'great')]
