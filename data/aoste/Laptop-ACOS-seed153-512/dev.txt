for home users , these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two - screening , to watching videos and calling family .####[('machines', 'positive', 'cheap')]
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####[('processor', 'positive', 'best')]
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####[('chromebook', 'neutral', 'negligible')]

the intel iris sucks .####[('intel iris', 'negative', 'sucks')]
now i ' m just down to some gripes that are probably here to stay : the bluetooth on this thing is really fussy , the non - functional video output ( using usb - c video out through an hdmi cable sends just a blank desktop background and no audio , even if i am playing a movie or youtube visibly on the c302 screen ) , and that it can ' t hold a vpn connection without dropping it every 20 - 30 minutes .####[('bluetooth', 'negative', 'fussy')]

anyhow , within a week , the speakers started crackling annoyingly when watching videos , or playing games .####[('speakers', 'negative', 'annoyingly')]
the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####[('native chrome os media player', 'negative', 'frustrated')]
it also had charging problems and got terrible warranty support .####[('warranty support', 'negative', 'terrible')]
i feel like i bought a decent machine but it ' s unable to handle the ram workload .####[('machine', 'positive', 'decent')]
