This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York .####[('gyros', 'positive')]
What really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .####[('gyro meat', 'positive'), ('food', 'positive'), ('ingredients', 'positive'), ('sausages', 'positive')]

However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####[('Korean fair', 'negative'), ('kimchee', 'negative')]
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####[('meal', 'negative')]
It was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive .####[('restaurant', 'negative')]

Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City####[('Restaurant', 'positive')]
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that don ’ t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !####[('modern Japanese brasserie', 'positive')]
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city .####[('décor', 'positive'), ('spot', 'neutral')]

I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better .####[('Grilled Black Cod', 'positive'), ('Grilled Salmon dish', 'positive')]
For desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .####[('frozen black sesame mousse', 'neutral'), ('matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake', 'positive')]
Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just can ’ t say enough good things about this brasserie .####[('brasserie', 'positive')]
The service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .####[('service', 'negative')]
They are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !####[('service', 'negative')]

Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan####[('Restaurant', 'negative')]
I 'll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .####[('hummus', 'positive'), ('decor', 'positive'), ('pita', 'positive'), ('grilled octopus', 'positive')]
It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .####[('scene', 'positive')]

Fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off –####[('food', 'positive')]
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .####[('front of house staff', 'negative'), ('waiters', 'positive'), ('fish dishes', 'positive')]

There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .####[('girl', 'negative')]
Considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service .####[('service', 'negative')]
The food and service were fine , however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .####[('maitre-D', 'negative'), ('food', 'positive'), ('service', 'positive')]
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .####[('bottle of wine', 'positive')]
This guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including Paris , that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .####[('frontman', 'negative')]

The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .####[('hostess', 'negative')]
