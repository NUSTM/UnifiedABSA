I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd .####[('restroom', 'negative')]
The bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .####[('bathroom', 'negative')]

- Mediocre Service / Quality####[('Service', 'neutral')]
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu .####[('menu', 'negative'), ('Snooze', 'negative')]
They serve it in a tall , skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .####[('juice', 'negative')]
I should have just asked for the check when I saw that ; but their menu was so unique that I continued .####[('menu', 'positive')]
The pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 '' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 '' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over-priced .####[('pancakes', 'negative')]
The pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 '' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .####[('pancakes', 'negative')]
In the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( I had water ) .####[('pancakes', 'negative')]
Much more than just a great view !####[('view', 'positive')]
– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray 's Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations .####[("Ray 's Boathouse", 'positive')]
Ray 's is something of a Seattle institution , but given its gorgeous Sound views , I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .####[('Sound views', 'positive')]
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray 's !####[("Ray 's", 'positive')]
To start things off , our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .####[('Brooke', 'positive')]
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , Ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .####[('butter sauce', 'positive'), ('manila clams', 'positive'), ('soy dressing', 'positive'), ('white gulf prawns', 'positive')]
For my entr & eacute ; e , I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano .####[('seared Alaskan sea scallops', 'positive')]
The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique ( not to mention tasty ) .####[('scallops', 'positive')]
My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .####[('creamed Washington russet potatoes', 'positive'), ('green beans', 'positive'), ('grilled Alaskan King Salmon', 'positive')]
I had a taste of all three items on her plate , and they were superb .####[('plate', 'positive')]
Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but I did remain puzzled by one issue : Who thinks that Ray 's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?####[("Ray 's", 'neutral'), ('server', 'positive')]
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .####[('food', 'positive'), ('server', 'positive')]
