the unit cost $ 275 to start with , so it is not worth repairing .####[('unit', 'negative')]
going from acer 15 to acer 11 was difficult , 11 inches seems too small for me .####[('acer 11', 'negative')]

i often find i ' ve typed an entire sentence ( or more ) with my fingers on the wrong keys , which is very unproductive when trying to take real - time notes in a meeting !####[('keys', 'negative')]
i know it only takes a few seconds , but a new device should not be doing this and makes me question if it ' ll get worse in the future .####[('device', 'negative')]
i also have to press the trackpad very hard for left click ( not as badly as the first unit , though ) , and i lost right click functionality on the track pad 2 days into my voyage with this thing .####[('track pad', 'negative')]
i tried factory resetting after i updated the os , and it still drained 9 % over 8 hours .####[('os', 'neutral')]
hdmi out doesn ' t work right .####[('hdmi', 'negative')]
i was excited to receive this chromebook , only to watch that excitement dissipate within mere hours as i noticed the touchscreen did n ' t work at all on tablet mode .####[('touchscreen', 'negative')]

this lead me to believe that although i purchased a “ new ” product , they sent me a refurbished one instead .####[('product', 'negative')]
i ' m out from us , i live in colombia , and maybe i can not return these laptop .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
i like the speed , the processor the hybrid storage units ( 128ssd and 1tera ) , but the web cam sucks , really poor resolution and the keyboard doesn ' t have the numerical part and the caps lock or num lock don ' t have any light or guide to help you .####[('processor', 'positive'), ('keyboard', 'negative'), ('num lock', 'negative'), ('web cam', 'negative'), ('hybrid storage units', 'positive'), ('caps lock', 'negative')]

after exactly one year of useage this computer completely stopped working .####[('computer', 'negative')]
it boots up in 10 seconds and shuts down in 2 to 3 seconds .####[('boots up', 'positive'), ('shuts down', 'positive')]
i like the idea that the keyboard lights up and has a ` ` time out ` ` feature to shut off .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]

i can certainly say this is the best laptop i ' ve ever had ( but then again i ' ve only had 3 , and you would expect these things to improve over time , right ) .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
- as others have mentioned , the keyboard backlight turns off after just a few seconds of not typing , which can be annoying and there doesn ' t seem to be a way to change this .####[('keyboard backlight', 'negative')]
- easily upgradeable ram####[('ram', 'positive')]
one feature that i love is the ability to disable the touchpad from the keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'positive'), ('touchpad', 'positive')]
after spending some time with it , the feature can really be useful .####[('feature', 'positive')]
easily upgrade to storage and ram .####[('ram', 'positive')]
this does not really matter to me because the mx150 is enough for my needs .####[('mx150', 'neutral')]
i love the solid state drive , as reviews or ads say you can boot up and get onto internet in 10 to 15 seconds .####[('solid state drive', 'positive')]
it ' s not a ` ` gaming ` ` laptop even it can do some more casual gaming .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
it ' s super fast , boots up in seconds .####[('boots up', 'positive')]

love the keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
i am still getting use to the chromebook but i love it lightweight easy to bring with me as it doesnt take up much room !####[('chromebook', 'positive')]

it ' s a very good lappy and i ' m happy with it , because it can still get all i need to do , done .####[('lappy', 'positive')]
for my needs it ' s a perfect computer with one major flaw : battery life is much shorter than they advertise !####[('computer', 'positive'), ('battery life', 'negative')]
mine did lose its screen backlight suddenly when i ' d had it less than a month .####[('screen', 'negative')]
fast processor .####[('processor', 'positive')]

finally got the warranty honored after almost 6 months .####[('warranty', 'negative')]
plenty of buyer returned it since the touch screen has phantom touch problems right after unboxing or it will eventually happen within 3 months .####[('touch screen', 'negative')]
consequently , i am no longer covered and my otherwise great chromebook becomes unusable anytime the phantom touches appear .####[('phantom touches', 'negative'), ('chromebook', 'positive')]
i have tried to fix the pixel with online videos and websites with no effect .####[('pixel', 'negative')]
the beautiful screen is said to be identical to the pixelbook in size , aspect ratio , and resolution .####[('screen', 'positive')]
idk if that ' s how chromeos usually is , or maybe there is something wrong with the hardware but this is very annoying .####[('hardware', 'negative')]
the touch screen works wonderfully .####[('touch screen', 'positive')]
as others have noted , the backspace key is small .####[('backspace key', 'negative')]
my biggest irk today though is that the screen is not very durable .####[('screen', 'negative')]
needless to say trip number three to best buy was a pure return , since being 0 / 2 on such an expensive device leaves a bad taste , you know ?####[('device', 'negative')]
gorgeous screen , small profile , lightweight , built in stylus , i could go on and on about how awesome this thing was .####[('profile', 'positive'), ('screen', 'positive'), ('stylus', 'positive')]
this review might be dismissed as i am missing the ` ` verified purchase ` ` stamp , which is fair .####[('verified purchase', 'neutral')]
the screen does look good .####[('screen', 'positive')]
terrible quality and not really enjoyable to use apps on the playstore .####[('apps', 'negative')]
battery life its ok .####[('battery life', 'neutral')]
another star off for android app support , which simply isn ' t ready for prime time .####[('android app support', 'negative')]
i didn ' t find a single android app that was optimized for chrome os ( not that my search was exhaustive , admittedly ) , so was disappointed pretty much every time .####[('android app', 'negative')]
battery life was mediocre , too , come to think of it .####[('battery life', 'neutral')]
amazon gave me the option of returning for refund or trying to have it repaired .####[('amazon', 'neutral')]
battery is good , display and keyboard are pretty great .####[('keyboard', 'positive'), ('display', 'positive'), ('battery', 'positive')]
there ' s nothing ` ` pro ` ` about this tablet .####[('tablet', 'negative')]
unless it ' s a really bad baby and chromeos + samsung = bad baby !####[('samsung', 'negative'), ('chromeos', 'negative')]
sounds nice until you realize that your computer just doesn ' t let you do things and then calls it secure .####[('computer', 'negative')]
the keyboard lacks a backlight which is inconvenient in low light situations .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
when you stack up all these strengths and offer them at a price of $ 299 , you ' re getting a fairly impressive value proposition here with this chromebook .####[('chromebook', 'positive')]
this isn ' t say the acer is bad in the abstract ; far from it .####[('acer', 'positive')]
it has a nice , oversize trackpad that - like pretty much all chromebooks - is responsive and a pleasure to use .####[('trackpad', 'positive')]
the performance never lags , it meets the 10 - 12 hour battery life promise in my usage tests , and it ' s quickly become my go - to computer for both home and work .####[('battery life', 'positive')]
this unit not only has a nice aluminum shell ( which is very attractive ) , but it also has a decent keyboard , with much better tactile properties than any chromebooks i ' ve looked at in the past .####[('aluminum shell', 'positive'), ('keyboard', 'positive')]
when i was comparing this model against other manufacturer ' s / model ' s , the only thing that made me pause was the lack of a card reader / writer .####[('card reader / writer', 'negative')]
this isn ' t a powerhouse , i ' ve never pushed it , it probably wouldn ' t handle the 20 + tabs over multiple windows / desktops that i ' m used to on chrome on the desktop , but for 99 % of ` ` regular people ` ` this is an unbelievably good laptop .####[('it', 'positive')]
the battery life is incredible and charges from 0 % to 100 % in about an hour and a half while in use .####[('battery life', 'positive')]
little bit of a learning curve with chrome os .####[('chrome os', 'negative')]
so it appears the play store does not recognize this devise at this time .####[('devise', 'negative')]
chromebook seems like the kind of device that you review after a few weeks , and by the time anything happens to it that affects use , the replacement will be just as much or cheaper , twice as powerful , and come with ` ` angry birds ` ` installed by default .####[('chromebook', 'negative')]
the hdmi and usb ports are on the left side , the back has no ports at all , and , misery !####[('hdmi and usb ports', 'negative')]

as for software , chromeos is a decent thin - client operating system which can do more than most people think .####[('chromeos', 'positive')]
i was hesitant at first because of the price , but i have to say that this is honestly an amazing machine .####[('machine', 'positive')]
secondly , this is a really aesthetically pleasing machine .####[('machine', 'positive')]
there are , as with everything , several growth opportunities for this model .####[('model', 'neutral')]
secondly , the trackpad feels a bit delicate .####[('trackpad', 'negative')]
the battery is good .####[('battery', 'positive')]
if you are looking for a laptop to check emails , watch movies , to shop , basic documentation , then this is an ideal one .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
