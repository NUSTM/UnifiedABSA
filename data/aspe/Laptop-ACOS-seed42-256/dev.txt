asus customer support was through chat and cumbersome .####[('asus customer support', 'negative')]
the screen is very dim however .####[('screen', 'negative')]

always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####[('machines', 'positive'), ('asus', 'positive')]
if you can save for 750 - 800 i would recommend going up a bit in the asus line .####[('asus', 'positive')]

the picture clarity is amazing and the backlit keyboard is awesome .####[('picture clarity', 'positive'), ('backlit keyboard', 'positive')]
also love that access to the hd / ssd and ram slots is really easy .####[('hd / ssd', 'positive'), ('ram slots', 'positive')]
acer seems to be the only one who puts together stuff like this .####[('acer', 'positive')]
it boots in seconds although i usually just leave it on constantly .####[('boots', 'positive')]

another expensive & poorly executed samsung product .####[('samsung product', 'negative')]
thankfully , this time , acer has gotten that part right .####[('acer', 'positive')]
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####[('toshiba', 'positive'), ('screen', 'positive'), ('build quality', 'negative')]
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####[('device', 'negative')]

as a 5 - year chromebook veteran , i ' ve been waiting for this machine .####[('machine', 'positive')]
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####[('processor', 'positive'), ('processor', 'negative')]
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####[('chromebook', 'neutral')]
- new ports that were not in the 2011 model : hdmi port , extra thunderbolt video port ( now it has two instead of one )####[('ports', 'positive')]
honestly , i think nobody uses these ports anyway .####[('ports', 'neutral')]
maybe that ' s a consequence of how the retina display is built , but yeah , it ' s harder to keep the screen clean .####[('screen', 'negative')]
i do wish the screen were bigger , but i had to go with the 13 ` ` due to budget constraints , so that ' s on me .####[('screen', 'neutral')]
