for now i ' m okay with upping the experience & device to 3 out of 5 stars .####[('device', 'neutral')]
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####[('track pad', 'negative')]
after some use , the battery charge had logically gone down some ( down to about 80 % ) , and so i went back to my office to plug it in .####[('battery', 'neutral')]

google is expecting to add that in sometime in the next year .####[('google', 'neutral')]
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####[('toshiba', 'positive'), ('screen', 'positive'), ('build quality', 'negative')]
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####[('device', 'negative')]

the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####[('native chrome os media player', 'negative')]

to say i ' m disappointed in this chromebook would be an understatement .####[('chromebook', 'negative')]
