we ate at the bar to avoid waiting for a table.####[('waiting', 'negative'), ('table', 'neutral')]
the food at pongal is average, the rava masala dosa is much better at madras mahal (a few doors down) and certainly the service at pongal is the worst among the indian restaurants along that block.####[('food', 'neutral'), ('rava masala dosa', 'positive'), ('service', 'negative')]
i am hoping the stale service was a one shot deal because it was deplorable for what we paid for dinner!####[('service', 'negative'), ('dinner', 'neutral')]

when we finally had to see the manager because i had lemon juice spilled on me from the waiter- she even took over 10 minutes to come to the table.####[('manager', 'negative'), ('table', 'neutral')]
our apetizers took quite a while to be served, in fact, while all the other tables that sat way after us were being served i asked the waiter what happened to our appetizers, the calamari was tough; the entrees were tasteless and really!, one have to be really bad to mess a simple pasta dish.####[('apetizers', 'neutral'), ('tables', 'neutral'), ('waiter', 'negative'), ('appetizers', 'neutral'), ('calamari', 'negative'), ('pasta dish', 'negative')]
a drink or two went by, but as we slowly realized our wait had become an hour from the promised 20 min, the server noted upon our inquiry that they recognized and remembered us and would seat us soon- rolling eye look- matched by a tone protesting the uncouth annoyance.####[('drink', 'neutral'), ('wait', 'neutral'), ('server', 'negative')]
seated by a moody hostess and presented a menu that included live food-samples.####[('hostess', 'negative'), ('menu', 'neutral')]

we ordered 1/2 bottle of gruner, 2 appetizers - foie gras and oysters, 2 entrees - steak and diver scallops, and 1 dessert, the pastry chef's favorite a mixture of crushed avocado, salt glazed caramel and lime sorbet (which really tasted like margarita infused guacamole, to try only if you're feeling wd-50 adventurous) for around $100.####[('appetizers', 'neutral'), ('foie gras and oysters', 'neutral'), ('entrees', 'neutral'), ('scallops', 'neutral'), ('dessert', 'neutral'), ('pastry chef', 'positive')]
on our second trip, our waiter had an attitude, was slow to bring/refill drinks, and we had to flag him down for everything.####[('waiter', 'negative'), ('drinks', 'neutral')]
we had to request water and chips (tostades) and salsa three times (the third time my date had to go and track down the waitress) before finally being served (by the busser) and the place wasn't even a quarter full.####[('water and chips (tostades)', 'neutral'), ('waitress', 'negative'), ('served', 'neutral'), ('place', 'negative')]
the service is ok since it is new and the staff didn't know the food items too well.####[('service', 'positive'), ('staff', 'negative'), ('food', 'neutral')]

expect to stand around for a while before one of the waiters desides that they can be bothered to actually get you to a seat.####[('waiters', 'negative'), ('seat', 'neutral')]
and you have to order through a pane of bulletproof glass, but the fact of the matter is, after a night of hard drinkin', college style, nothing hits the spot like a big box of inexpensive chicken and fries.####[('bulletproof glass', 'neutral'), ('style', 'neutral'), ('fries', 'positive')]
if it's just a quick martini at the bar (which i recommend jeffery's) or a mind blowing roast chicken, go to village!####[('martini', 'positive'), ('bar', 'neutral'), ('roast chicken', 'positive')]
40 minutes later, the waitress finally looked at our table and we asked about our dishes.####[('waitress', 'negative'), ('dishes', 'neutral')]

this restaurant was a great value, even though i know nothing about the prix fixe menu.####[('value', 'positive'), ('prix fixe menu', 'neutral')]

sadly, many people feel the need to berate their server for a stronger drink.####[('server', 'negative'), ('drink', 'neutral')]
martinis from the bar are mixed at the size of 1 1/2 drinks, and the wait staff leaves the whole glass there, returning to pour you your remaining drink as your glass empties.####[('martinis', 'neutral'), ('bar', 'neutral'), ('drinks', 'neutral'), ('wait staff', 'negative'), ('glass empties', 'neutral')]
they moved us upstairs to an area where they were setting up for a private party -- we had no server, and had to flag down people setting up for the party to get us drinks, silverware, water, etc.####[('server', 'negative'), ('drinks', 'neutral'), ('water', 'neutral')]

we had over 100 beers to choose from and the food and service was excellent.####[('beers', 'neutral'), ('food', 'positive'), ('service', 'positive')]
for 2 patrons paying over $100 for dinner, you'd think that the waiter would check to see if everything was okay with the dining experience, and he certainly did not.####[('dinner', 'neutral'), ('waiter', 'negative')]
yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken.####[('waiting area', 'negative'), ('bar', 'neutral')]

we wouldn't bother quibbling over the price of a few drinks anyway but i wonder why they would offer if they weren't intending to back it up.####[('price', 'negative'), ('drinks', 'neutral')]

great food, but not low fat.####[('food', 'positive'), ('fat', 'negative')]

i can't imagine how small the fish portion on the $10 lunch menu must be if i got the large one.####[('fish portion', 'negative'), ('lunch menu', 'neutral'), ('one', 'positive')]
i just think the prices are high for the type of food the kitchen turns out as well as the portion sizes.####[('prices', 'negative'), ('food', 'neutral'), ('portion sizes', 'neutral')]

the uptight female manager came up to our table and rudely asked us to get up because they had a party waiting to eat.####[('manager', 'negative'), ('waiting', 'neutral')]

fortunately the hostess was nice enough to take our appetizers off the bill after we complained.####[('hostess', 'positive'), ('appetizers', 'neutral')]
the service is smart and though they can be overwhelmed with the crowds, does a good job.####[('service', 'positive'), ('crowds', 'neutral')]
appetizers took their sweet time in coming, and literally about an hour later we had our main dishes which were very small considering the price.####[('appetizers', 'neutral'), ('time', 'positive'), ('main dishes', 'negative'), ('price', 'neutral')]
the food had a somewhat elevated price tag but but fair considering the nobu origin - the cocktails highly recommended including the spide and lobster roll - we were well plated and did not encounter any arragance from the staff - maybe the other student reviewers are used to cafeteria service.####[('price', 'negative'), ('cocktails', 'positive'), ('spide', 'positive'), ('lobster roll', 'positive'), ('staff', 'negative'), ('service', 'negative')]

one waiter came by and literally threw the $36 salad on the table.####[('waiter', 'negative'), ('salad', 'neutral'), ('table', 'neutral')]

to sm's credit, our waiter was eventually replaced and the matre d' offered us free dessert, but we're not going back there ever again.####[('waiter', 'neutral'), ('dessert', 'positive')]
the entrance is a bit unwelcoming, after you pass throught the glass doors you enter a cedar rich hallway and the woods at the entrance and downstairs are rich, but to my horror the main dining room is wallpapered in faux wood veneer making it look like a bad episode of trading spaces.####[('glass doors', 'neutral'), ('woods', 'positive')]
it's a shame you can't even sample the food or sit in what is a very nice space.####[('food', 'neutral'), ('space', 'positive')]
also, when i was waiting to be seated the bartender gave great service and mixed a mean cocktail for me.####[('bartender', 'neutral'), ('service', 'positive'), ('cocktail', 'positive')]

this place is good but food and service is presented for the masses, not much personalized service considering the price tag and that it is a  full-evening-out type of dinner place.####[('food', 'negative'), ('dinner place', 'neutral')]
while it can get pricey, 25$ for a lobster 3sides and a refillable drink, its tons of fun, and the food tastes great!####[('lobster', 'neutral'), ('refillable drink', 'neutral'), ('food', 'positive')]
the waiter said they mixed it up because there were three similar things on the menu.####[('waiter', 'negative'), ('menu', 'neutral')]

the calamari salad was huge (but delicious)--it could be a meal unto itself.####[('calamari salad', 'positive'), ('meal', 'neutral')]
