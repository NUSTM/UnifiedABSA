the outdoor patio is really nice in good weather, but what ambience the indoors possesses is negated by the noise and the crowds.####[('outdoor patio', 'positive'), ('ambience', 'neutral')]
the food there's a trimmed-down version of the regular blue ribbon menu--all manner of sandwiches, and a solid selection of american main courses--but the real attraction is the vast, well-edited range of cheese, fish and vegetable portions (goodies like foie gras terrine aside, the meat selections are disappointingly indistinct).####[('food', 'neutral'), ('blue ribbon menu', 'neutral'), ('sandwiches', 'neutral'), ('range of cheese', 'positive'), ('vegetable portions', 'positive')]
