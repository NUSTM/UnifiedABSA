when i walked in , i was taken aback by their incredible wood decor .####[('wood decor', 'positive')]
the music playing was very hip , 20 - 30 something pop music , but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat , which became annoying midway through dinner .####[('subwoofer to the sound system', 'negative'), ('music', 'positive')]
i got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright .####[('shellfish and shrimp appetizer', 'neutral')]
it was n ' t the freshest seafood ever , but the taste and presentation was ok .####[('seafood', 'neutral')]
i picked the asparagus , which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared .####[('asparagus', 'positive')]
the 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great , at least initially .####[('9 oz steak', 'positive')]
the steak was done to my exact liking ( medium rare ) and was nice and juicy .####[('steak', 'positive')]
it ? s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste .####[('peppercorn sauce', 'neutral'), ('red wine reduction', 'neutral')]
though , one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak .####[('steak', 'negative')]
the desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner .####[('desert', 'positive'), ('dinner', 'positive')]
overall , i would go back and eat at the restaurant again .####[('restaurant', 'positive')]

the waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded .####[('waiter', 'negative'), ('feel', 'negative')]
also , there was only one bathroom stall - probably need more for such big crowds .####[('bathroom stall', 'positive')]
most importantly , we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu .####[('menu', 'positive')]
at best , the food was good and definately overpriced .####[('food', 'positive'), ('food', 'negative')]

i have been here , spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment .####[('chef special dinner', 'negative')]

to the owners of open sesame . . . bravo . . . i ca n ' t wait to come back to dine at your restaurant !####[('open sesame', 'positive')]
it ' s a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend ( thurs ? sun ) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar .####[('place', 'neutral')]
everything , and i mean everything on the menu is delectable .####[('menu', 'positive')]
the waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .####[('waiters', 'positive')]

the pizza itself is not exactly the best i ' ve had ever , but still pretty good .####[('pizza', 'positive')]
food was good and appetizing .####[('food', 'positive')]
portions was just enough for me , but may not be for a big eater .####[('portions', 'neutral')]
fair menu selection .####[('menu selection', 'neutral')]
the appetizer was interesting , but the creme brulee was very savory and delicious .####[('appetizer', 'positive'), ('creme brulee', 'positive')]

groovy music made the dinner casual .####[('music', 'positive')]
i have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd .####[('restroom', 'negative')]
the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .####[('bathroom', 'negative')]
– mercedes restaurant is so tasty , the service is undeniably awesome !####[('service', 'positive')]
the catering is out of this world , and raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world ! ! !####[('raouls chicken vegetable soup', 'positive'), ('catering', 'positive')]
drinks are suberb , and i feel like i am in a third world country when i walk in the door .####[('drinks', 'positive')]
the presentation of snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu .####[('snooze', 'negative'), ('menu', 'negative')]
to start off , approximately 8 - 10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 .####[('orange juice', 'negative')]
they serve it in a tall , skinny hour - glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .####[('juice', 'negative')]
i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their menu was so unique that i continued .####[('menu', 'positive')]
the pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8 . 50 for 3 - 6 ' ' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 ' ' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over - priced .####[('pancakes', 'positive'), ('pancakes', 'negative')]
the pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 ' ' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .####[('pancakes', 'negative')]
on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if i had n ' t rejected the meal all together .####[('eggs', 'negative'), ('meal', 'negative')]
i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue .####[('dish', 'negative')]

much more than just a great view !####[('view', 'positive')]
– i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray ' s boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations .####[("ray ' s boathouse", 'positive')]
ray ' s is something of a seattle institution , but given its gorgeous sound views , i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .####[('sound views', 'positive')]
imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third - best thing about ray ' s !####[('views', 'positive'), ("ray ' s", 'positive')]
to start things off , our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .####[('brooke', 'positive')]
my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the shilshole sampler . . . a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , ray ' s fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .####[('soy dressing', 'positive'), ('white gulf prawns', 'positive'), ('manila clams', 'positive'), ('butter sauce', 'positive')]
for my entr & eacute ; e , i completely enjoyed the seared alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano .####[('seared alaskan sea scallops', 'positive')]
the scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique ( not to mention tasty ) .####[('scallops', 'positive')]
my friend enjoyed the grilled alaskan king salmon with delectable creamed washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .####[('grilled alaskan king salmon', 'positive'), ('green beans', 'positive'), ('creamed washington russet potatoes', 'positive')]
i had a taste of all three items on her plate , and they were superb .####[('plate', 'positive')]
our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but i did remain puzzled by one issue : who thinks that ray ' s is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?####[('server', 'positive'), ("ray ' s", 'neutral')]
while i could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .####[('server', 'positive'), ('food', 'positive')]
oh yeah . . . the view was good , too .####[('view', 'positive')]
– i ca n ' t say enough about this place .####[('place', 'positive')]

finally a meal that you will remember for a long time !####[('meal', 'positive')]
every time ` ` 0 - sixtynine ' ' is called the bartender buys everyone drinks !####[('bartender', 'positive')]
unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks i would n ' t recommend going here .####[('drinks', 'positive')]
it was romantic - and even nice even with my sister , reminded me of italy , and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a mediterrean villa .####[('artwork', 'positive'), ('music', 'positive')]
i should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild .####[('food', 'positive')]
lebanese food ! yum !####[('lebanese food', 'positive')]
– i ' ve been to open sesame only once , but i ' m still reeling from the experience ! !####[('open sesame', 'positive')]
we have since returned and also had a great experience , sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good ) .####[('beer', 'positive')]
we did have the same waiter the second time , so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good .####[('waiter', 'positive')]
sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun .####[('band', 'negative')]
i hope one day scooner or later returns to what it once was .####[('scooner or later', 'negative')]

seafood plus####[('seafood', 'positive')]
we had a very hard time getting the waitress ' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .####[('waitress', 'negative')]
as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 % discount on our bill .####[('owner', 'negative')]
i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n ' t work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link .####[('restaurant', 'negative')]
after sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she ' d be right with us .####[('bar keep', 'negative')]
management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners .####[('waitstaff', 'negative'), ('management', 'negative')]
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee . . . oh la la yummy ! ! !####[('mango ginger creme brulee', 'positive')]
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant .####[('restaurant', 'positive')]
i ' m astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ .####[('restaurant', 'negative')]
in other words , if they are n ' t making $ $ off of you then you do n ' t rate high on their ' service scale ' .####[('service', 'negative')]
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment - - to say we had been ` ` blown off ' ' would be an understatement .####[('manager', 'negative')]
the manager continually interrupted with ` ` is there anything else i can do for you ? ` ` , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .####[('manager', 'negative')]
you are with a hot date and he / she has an urge for sushi . . . then this might be the place .####[('sushi', 'positive')]
we were only in seattle for one night and i ' m so glad we picked rays for dinner !####[('rays', 'positive')]

i do n ' t know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place .####[('place', 'negative')]
sit in the balcony####[('balcony', 'neutral')]
although the service could be improved considering the money you put in .####[('service', 'negative')]
our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times .####[('server', 'negative')]
this place rocks ! !####[('place', 'positive')]
the chips and salsa are so yummy , and the prices are fabulous .####[('salsa', 'positive'), ('chips', 'positive')]
the atmosphere is aspiring , and the decor is festive and amazing . .####[('atmosphere', 'positive'), ('decor', 'positive')]
- mediocre service / quality####[('service', 'neutral')]
to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .####[('manager', 'negative')]
all considered , i have to say that ray ' s boathouse is deserving of its title as a seattle institution .####[("ray ' s boathouse", 'positive')]
