this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york .####[('gyros', 'positive')]

i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .####[('manager', 'negative'), ('manager', 'positive')]
the manager finally said he would com # # p the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .####[('manager', 'negative')]
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .####[('food', 'negative')]
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .####[('restaurant', 'positive'), ('customer service', 'negative')]

we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .####[('waiter', 'negative')]
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .####[('chicken', 'negative')]
i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .####[('dinner', 'negative')]

however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it ' s your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####[('korean fair', 'negative'), ('kimchee', 'negative')]
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .####[('food', 'negative')]
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####[('meal', 'negative')]
it was n ' t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it ' s simply repulsive .####[('restaurant', 'negative')]

so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it .####[('spinach', 'negative')]
this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it ' s a matter of taste that she did n ' t like it , and i can not comp it .####[('manager', 'negative')]

fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n ' t put you off –####[('front of house staff', 'negative'), ('food', 'positive')]
each time we ' ve been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they ' re fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .####[('waiters', 'positive'), ('fish dishes', 'positive'), ('front of house staff', 'negative')]
as bfc does n ' t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####[('bfc', 'negative'), ('front of house staff', 'negative')]
the frizzy retro girl ( with winged / dame edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .####[('girl', 'negative')]

there ' s another girl who i ca n ' t describe , she is about 5 ' 6 ' ' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you ' re * really * talking about .####[('girl', 'negative')]
considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service .####[('service', 'negative')]

while finishing our meals which included a high - end bottle of wine , our son ' s fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .####[('bottle of wine', 'positive')]
this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .####[('frontman', 'negative')]

taking hot dogs to the next level####[('hot dogs', 'positive')]
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at bark you do n ' t just get your average hot dog .####[('hot dog', 'positive'), ('bark', 'negative')]

the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .####[('waiter', 'negative')]
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .####[('waitress', 'negative')]
