Caution - its real food for people who love the best .####['food']
I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price .####['food', 'atmosphere']
I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it .####['food']
Rice is too dry , tuna was n't so fresh either .####['tuna', 'Rice']
I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent .####['fish']
However , the value and service are both severely lacking .####['service']
Furthermore , while the fish is unquestionably fresh , rolls tend to be inexplicably bland .####['rolls', 'fish']
The service ranges from mediocre to offensive .####['service']
On a recent trip , our waiter was extremely dismissive , while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby .####['waiter']
Freshest sushi – I love this restaurant .####['sushi', 'restaurant']
They pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls .####['rolls']
The sashimi was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted .####['sashimi']

Mediocre food####['food']
The outside patio area has an abbreviated menu .####['menu']
My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price .####['food']

Service was decent .####['Service']
Drinks were good .####['Drinks']
Excellent food , nice ambience , fairly expensive####['food', 'ambience']
– I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi ( 5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis ) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes .####['pumpkin ravioli', 'goat cheese gnocchi', 'filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes']

Poor customer service / poor pizza .####['pizza', 'customer service']
– As with most restaurants in Seattle , Mioposto 's service was bad and the food was overpriced .####['food', 'service']
I know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places , but Mioposto 's pizza lacks quality and good taste .####['pizza']
To be honest , I 've had better frozen pizza .####['pizza']
The only positive thing about Mioposto is the nice location .####['location']
I was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews - this place is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way , and we 've eaten here more than 10 times .####['place']
The food is fantastic , and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we 've been there .####['food', 'waiting staff']

Also love their caeser salad .####['caeser salad']
Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I do n't like the servers , one young woman in particular .####['servers', 'young woman']
Many people talk about the great pizza and poor service , so it ca n't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers .####['pizza', 'service']
It 's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n't so impersonal and corporate-like .####['place']
Great Breakfast####['Breakfast']
The food is great and they make a mean bloody mary .####['food', 'bloody mary']

so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty .####['walnuts', 'batter', 'prawns']
best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted .####['honey walnyt prawns']
the brocollis were so fresh and tasty .####['brocollis']
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time , every piece was as eventful as the first one ... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked .####['scallops', 'prawns']
Chintzy portions####['portions']
– The sushi here is perfectly good , but for $ 5 a piece , either the slices of fish should be larger , or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant ( even for NYC ) .####['sushi', 'restaurant']
Terrible service , food ok , pricey####['food', 'service']
Food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n't a fancy place .####['Food', 'restaurant']
Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides .####['feel']
Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi ( that eel with avodcao -- um um um ) .####['box sushi', 'Spanish Mackeral special appetizer']
As usual the omikase did n't disappoint in freshness , although it scored low on creativity and selection .####['omikase']
Their specialty rolls are impressive , though I ca n't remember what we had .####['specialty rolls']
Great selection of sakes .####['selection of sakes']
It is n't the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time .####['sushi']
Very poor customer service .####['customer service']
– Schooner or Later 's charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not , unfortunately , compensate for its very poor customer service .####['customer service']
While this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service .####['food', 'restaurant staff']
the fish was fresh , though it was cut very thin .####['fish']
great service .####['service']
good sake selection .####['sake selection']
– Ray 's is THE place to go for high quality seafood dinners .####['seafood dinners']

But the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly .####['servers']
good sake , good food – i honestly do n't know much about japanese food at all .####['food', 'sake']
Server made several sake suggestions which were very good .####['sake']
had many dishes but the BEST was the lobster 3 ways .####['lobster 3 ways']
The waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded .####['feel', 'waiter']

Our server was very professional and friendly .####['server']
It 's a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend ( Thurs ? Sun ) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar .####['place']
Everything , and I mean everything on the menu is delectable .####['menu']
The waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .####['waiters']
The sushi is as fresh as it comes ? you 'd think ocean was in their backyard , no joke !####['sushi']

- Mediocre Service / Quality####['Service']
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu .####['menu', 'Snooze']
They serve it in a tall , skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .####['juice']
I should have just asked for the check when I saw that ; but their menu was so unique that I continued .####['menu']
The pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 '' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 '' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over-priced .####['pancakes']
The pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 '' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .####['pancakes']
In the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( I had water ) .####['pancakes']
Much more than just a great view !####['view']
– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray 's Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations .####["Ray 's Boathouse"]
Ray 's is something of a Seattle institution , but given its gorgeous Sound views , I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .####['Sound views']
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray 's !####["Ray 's"]
To start things off , our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .####['Brooke']
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , Ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .####['manila clams', 'soy dressing', 'white gulf prawns', 'butter sauce']
For my entr & eacute ; e , I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano .####['seared Alaskan sea scallops']
The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique ( not to mention tasty ) .####['scallops']
My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .####['creamed Washington russet potatoes', 'green beans', 'grilled Alaskan King Salmon']
I had a taste of all three items on her plate , and they were superb .####['plate']
Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but I did remain puzzled by one issue : Who thinks that Ray 's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?####['server', "Ray 's"]
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .####['food', 'server']
Oh yeah ... the view was good , too .####['view']
