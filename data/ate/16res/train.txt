The food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy .####['food']
Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .####['looks']
Subtle food and service####['food', 'service']
Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy .####['food', 'service']
Servers are all different , Greg is my favorite .####['Greg']
I go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .####['servers']

The have a great cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for !####['cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves']
We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .####['belly dancing show']
I never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !####['restaurant']
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .####['food']
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .####['customer service', 'restaurant']
Great place , great value .####['place']
The food is flavorful , plentiful and reasonably priced .####['food']
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual .####['atmosphere']
Sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance .####['Sushi']
Good creative rolls !####['rolls']
They have great rolls , the triple color and norwegetan rolls , are awesome and filling .####['rolls', 'triple color and norwegetan rolls']
One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !####['special roll', 'dessert', 'regular roll']
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert , as well as a great green tea tempura .####['banana chocolate dessert', 'green tea tempura']
The appetizers are also delicious !####['appetizers']
Amazing food .####['food']
Mazing interior .####['interior']
Great food !####['food']
The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .####['scheme of mirrors', 'atmosphere']
Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future .####['mirrors', 'modern Japanese food']
Indo Chinese food , pretty good ...####['Indo Chinese food']
Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food .####['place', 'Chinese style Indian food']
The chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( I have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the Chilli Chicken .####['chicken lollipop', 'dishes', 'Chilli Chicken']
My mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she ( being Indian ) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .####['food']
I was speechless by the horrible food .####['food']
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .####['food']
This is the MOST wonderful restaurant in all of New York City , not just Brooklyn ...####['restaurant']
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty , most delicious food and kept it that way ...####['food']
never swaying , never a bad meal , never bad service ...####['meal', 'service']
great food , great wine list , great service in a great neighborhood ...####['wine list', 'food', 'service', 'neighborhood']
Patsy 's Pizza - true love####["Patsy 's Pizza"]
Hands down the best pizza on the planet .####['pizza']
great hot dogs .####['hot dogs']
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .####['hot dogs']
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !####['toppings']
For me dishes a little oily , but overall dining experience good .####['dishes']
Helpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .####['service']
The only thing that strikes you is the decor ? ( not very pleasant ) .####['decor']
great food####['food']
This place has great indian chinese food .####['indian chinese food']
Be prepared to wait , because the place is pretty tiny .####['place']
Even though the place is not beautiful , the food speaks for itself .####['food', 'place']
Best Indian Chinese in the city , by far !####['Indian Chinese']
The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced .####['martinis']
THE SERVICE IS AMAZING , i 've had different waiters and they were all nice , which is a rare thing in NYC .####['waiters', 'SERVICE']
The DJ is awesome , I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back .####['DJ']
This establishment is the real deal .####['establishment']
Wish NY had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .####['food']
Look , the appetizers were really good .####['appetizers']
The entree was also very good .####['entree']
Yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .####['place']
Vanison was good but not amazing .####['Vanison']
Dessert : pure disaster .####['Dessert']
I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .####['restaurant']
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .####['environment']
If you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .####['food']
You would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .####['service']
Service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .####['Service']
I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .####['Casa La Femme']
The place is beautiful !####['place']
The hostess was very pleasant .####['hostess']
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .####['waiter']
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .####['chicken']
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !####['food']
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !####['meal']
I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .####['restaurant']
There was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .####['beer']
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .####['fried oysters and clams']
The lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .####['lobster knuckles']
I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass ... which was very good .####['Thai style Fried Sea Bass']
Everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi , seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice !####['food', 'grilled Mahi Mahi']
I heard the lobster roll was excellent .####['lobster roll']
Service not the friendliest to our `` large party '' !####['Service']
Great Indian food####['Indian food']
Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly , but I can say this is one of the best I 've had .####['Food']
Very `` normal Indian food '' , but done really well .####['Indian food']
The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .####['lunch buffet']
We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given .####['service', 'dinner']
Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC####['Bukhara']
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service .####['food', 'service']
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####['Korean fair', 'kimchee']
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####['meal']
I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .####['white organza tent', 'four course prix fix menu']
The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing !####['service', 'waiter']
I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date .####['Casa La Femme']
The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling .####['bibimbap', 'stone bowl']
Too bad I had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .####['stone bowl']
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I 've ever tasted .####['stir-fried squid']
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service .####['service']
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .####['farro salad', 'mashed yukon potatoes']
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza####['margherita pizza', 'east village pizza']
Love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go .####['place']
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza .####['slice of NYC pizza']
Personally I like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .####['margherita pizza']
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City####['Restaurant']
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that don ’ t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !####['modern Japanese brasserie']
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city .####['spot', 'décor']
If you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .####['private booths']
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .####['sashimi amuse bouche']
For desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .####['frozen black sesame mousse', 'matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake']
Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just can ’ t say enough good things about this brasserie .####['brasserie']
They are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !####['service']
Great Shabu Shabu####['Shabu Shabu']
I tried a couple other dishes but was n't too impressed .####['dishes']
The meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .####['kimchi', 'meat', 'sauces', 'service', 'salad']
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .####['Korean food', 'pork belly tacos', 'fusion twists']
The food tasted very good .####['food']
The main entree was also very good .####['main entree']
This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ...####['decor', 'mirrored walls']
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n't work .####['japanese tapas']
The food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked .####['food']
Good Food####['Food']
The food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I do n't like being cramp in a corner .####['food', 'sitting space']
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .####['place']
The atmosphere was great .####['atmosphere']
Our waitress was n't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####['waitress']
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####['restaurant']
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .####['servers']
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####['appetizer', 'server']
Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest .####['food']
The place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins )####['wine list', 'fit-out', 'furnishings']
Everything was going good until we got our meals .####['meals']
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .####['chicken']
It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .####['spinach']
I took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .####['salmon']
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .####['manager']
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .####['drinks', 'appetizers']
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .####['STAFF']
cirspy crust margherita pizza####['margherita pizza']
it was really good pizza .####['pizza']
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded : ) : ) : )####['crust', 'pizza']
Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan####['Restaurant']
I 'll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .####['decor', 'pita', 'grilled octopus', 'hummus']
It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .####['scene']
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME ! ! ! !####['decor', 'eggplant']
Great Hot Dogs !####['Hot Dogs']
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !####['Bark']
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off –####['food']
Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .####['waiters', 'front of house staff', 'fish dishes']
As BFC does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####['front of house staff']
The frizzy retro girl ( with winged/ Dame Edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .####['girl']
I 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !####['staff']
There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .####['girl']
Considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service .####['service']
The food and service were fine , however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .####['food', 'service', 'maitre-D']
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .####['bottle of wine']
Best meal in a long time !####['meal']
My father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish .####['flank steak']
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience .####['The Four Seasons restaurant']
The food is great and the environment is even better .####['food', 'environment']
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .####['hot dog']
Great Atmosphere####['Atmosphere']
I highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .####['fish tacos']
Cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .####['atmosphere']
Poor service and management####['service', 'management']
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner .####['Casa la Femme']
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .####['manager']
Can ’ t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .####['restaurant']
The food is very good , but not outstanding .####['food']
The bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .####['bread', 'salad']
The pasta was well cooked , did n't have enough sauce though or flavor .####['pasta']
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .####['hostess']
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .####['bartender']
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service .####['staff', 'customer service']
bad staff####['staff']
I generally like this place .####['place']
The food is good .####['food']
The design of the space is good .####['space']
