this device ( and its brother the plus ) has a grave hardware flaw that causes the touchscreen to move on its own .####['touchscreen', 'hardware']

i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of keyboards and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .####['keyboards']
except , you know , when it decided to become unusable .####['it']
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####['keyboard']
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .####['keyboard']
it ' s great in many ways ; the build is solid , the screen is good ( and the resolution is insane ) , and the keyboard is decent , though only time will tell if it ' s as diet coke - resistant as the samsung ' s keys are .####['keyboard', 'screen', 'build', 'resolution']
the 1080p display is very sharp .####['1080p display']

i ' ve been waiting for this chromebook for some time now and having only had it for about two weeks , i can say that the device and purchase were well worth it .####['device', 'chromebook']
the surface texture of the case is a satiny paper - like touch , which is both clean and easy to wipe down , but also not so smooth that you have to be concerned with it slipping out of your hand when carrying it .####['surface texture of the case']
- backlit keyboard rocks####['backlit keyboard']
