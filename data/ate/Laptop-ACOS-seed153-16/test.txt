the unit cost $ 275 to start with , so it is not worth repairing .####['unit']
going from acer 15 to acer 11 was difficult , 11 inches seems too small for me .####['acer 11']
also it ' s not a true ssd drive in there but emmc , which makes a difference .####['ssd drive']
the computer has difficulty switching between tablet and computer .####['computer']
2 / 28 / 18 - a couple days ago i updated the chrome os .####['chrome os']
it ' s just that chrome doesn ' t work the same with a chromebook as it does with windows .####['chrome']
i rarely use the keyboard .####['keyboard']
- great price for a touchscreen chromebook####['touchscreen chromebook']
i ordered one , the touch pad failed to work consistently .####['touch pad']
i often find i ' ve typed an entire sentence ( or more ) with my fingers on the wrong keys , which is very unproductive when trying to take real - time notes in a meeting !####['keys']
i know it only takes a few seconds , but a new device should not be doing this and makes me question if it ' ll get worse in the future .####['device']
i also have to press the trackpad very hard for left click ( not as badly as the first unit , though ) , and i lost right click functionality on the track pad 2 days into my voyage with this thing .####['track pad']
i tried factory resetting after i updated the os , and it still drained 9 % over 8 hours .####['os']
hdmi out doesn ' t work right .####['hdmi']
i was excited to receive this chromebook , only to watch that excitement dissipate within mere hours as i noticed the touchscreen did n ' t work at all on tablet mode .####['touchscreen']
clearly there is some kind of major defect here that acer has n ' t resolved .####['acer']
decent sound quality .####['sound']
flimsy power adapter .####['power adapter']
wi - fi slows down to crowl and speeds back up intermittently .####['wi - fi']
the product is great , but the customer support is horrible .####['customer support', 'product']
called support a second time after 10 minutes of verifying some type of info they told me to call google without even trying to help .####['support']
the screen looked great .####['screen']
no matter how many times i reinserted the charging adapter , i kept getting this message .####['charging adapter']
i had no option but to shut down the computer , unplug it , plug it back in , and then reboot .####['computer']
the screen flashes for a second every 30 seconds or so .####['screen']
i noticed the battery went down to 67 % for no reason .####['battery']
works good but the fan kicks in pretty often , which is to keep the laptop cool but the sound is annoying .####['sound', 'fan']
nano edge display is nice .####['nano edge display']
the audio is almost impossible to hear .####['audio']
it doesn ' t has backlit keyboard : ( typing in low light is such a pain .####['backlit keyboard']
keyboard and mouse pad seem fine , but overall it seems strangely slow .####['keyboard', 'mouse pad']
crazy keypad : this issue is even worse .####['keypad']
overall , the laptop has a solid feel to it .####['laptop']
this lead me to believe that although i purchased a “ new ” product , they sent me a refurbished one instead .####['product']
i ' m out from us , i live in colombia , and maybe i can not return these laptop .####['laptop']
i like the speed , the processor the hybrid storage units ( 128ssd and 1tera ) , but the web cam sucks , really poor resolution and the keyboard doesn ' t have the numerical part and the caps lock or num lock don ' t have any light or guide to help you .####['processor', 'keyboard', 'num lock', 'hybrid storage units', 'web cam', 'caps lock']
yesterday the backlight went out .####['backlight']
now i have to deal with warranty stuff and sending it back etc .####['warranty stuff']
ram upgrade available####['ram']
hard drive upgrade available####['hard drive']
i had issues with the touchpad sticking or not responding to click correctly from the start .####['touchpad']
it ' s still a mainly functional computer , but using it is just not the greatest .####['computer']
we ' ve had the computer for 5 weeks , used it a total of less than 20 hours , and now it will be gone for 3 weeks .####['computer']
i send it to asus warranty and now after a week they ' re sending it back stating the no problem was found .####['asus warranty']
display stop working within 2 months .####['display']
since it came with no user manual , i had to call asus customer support and got someone who knew all about windows 10 software but nothing about my asus notebook .####['asus customer support']
all over this asus laptop which has a non - functioning touchpad .####['touchpad', 'asus laptop']
my screen broke when just putting a textbook on it .####['screen']
don ' t even bother calling customer support , in my experience , they do you no good .####['customer support']
keyboard needs to be redesigned entirely .####['keyboard']
6 ` ` screen is big enough to read with ease , yet the item itself is light enough to tote to meetings .####['item']
so far , this looks as if it meets my needs as a good ` ` work machine . ` `####['work machine']
after exactly one year of useage this computer completely stopped working .####['computer']
it boots up in 10 seconds and shuts down in 2 to 3 seconds .####['boots up', 'shuts down']
i like the idea that the keyboard lights up and has a ` ` time out ` ` feature to shut off .####['keyboard']
+ decent quantity of available ports####['ports']
+ it has a dvd drive : o####['dvd drive']
- new i5 mobile processor .####['i5 mobile processor']
- ddr4 ram that is upgradable .####['ddr4 ram']
- very decent battery life .####['battery life']
so far i am pleasantly impressed with this unit , however i have not used it a long time or tested many applications to date .####['unit']
i can certainly say this is the best laptop i ' ve ever had ( but then again i ' ve only had 3 , and you would expect these things to improve over time , right ) .####['laptop']
- as others have mentioned , the keyboard backlight turns off after just a few seconds of not typing , which can be annoying and there doesn ' t seem to be a way to change this .####['keyboard backlight']
- easily upgradeable ram####['ram']
one feature that i love is the ability to disable the touchpad from the keyboard .####['keyboard', 'touchpad']
after spending some time with it , the feature can really be useful .####['feature']
easily upgrade to storage and ram .####['ram']
this does not really matter to me because the mx150 is enough for my needs .####['mx150']
i love the solid state drive , as reviews or ads say you can boot up and get onto internet in 10 to 15 seconds .####['solid state drive']
it ' s not a ` ` gaming ` ` laptop even it can do some more casual gaming .####['laptop']
it ' s super fast , boots up in seconds .####['boots up']
i am very impressed with this system .####['system']
mastercam itself runs pretty good .####['mastercam']
as usual amazon was great about returning it .####['amazon']
screen is decent , not great , it is matte finished .####['screen']
i like the back lit keyboard .####['back lit keyboard']
the screen is perfectly adequate .####['screen']
this thing boots up super quick and it sleek and beautiful .####['boots up']
google and partners have done great with chromebooks and have plenty of features to accommodate .####['google and partners']
i ' m getting very used to the multiple finger shortcuts on the touch pad when navigating chrome .####['touch pad']
i chose to purchase a samsung chromebook this time just to try out a different company and because it was inexpensive ( i paid $ 189 .####['samsung chromebook']
i couldn ' t be happier with this product !####['product']
the screen hinge is super strong and it ' s hard to imagine it breaking unless you dropped it .####['screen hinge']
the size is perfect , it ' s easy to toss it in my satchel or backpack along with my textbook and notebooks and have plenty of room .####['size']
the battery life on this seems good .####['battery life']
this chromebook instantly connects to the internet .####['chromebook']
going to a grocery store or fitness center , the android tablets took so long to connect that i finished my shopping before they came online .####['android tablets']
powers up immediately , great battery life , great keyboard , amazing features .####['keyboard', 'powers up', 'battery life']
this is my third samsung chromebook and i will continue to use this brand .####['brand', 'samsung chromebook']
does not act like a tablet , but it can have almost 10 tabs open before affecting performance , including video streaming .####['tablet']
great price for a good book used for college students who carry all day####['book']
this laptop is very straight forward .####['laptop']
also , secure os .####['os']
the product itself is awesome .####['product']
great little laptop and tablet !####['laptop', 'tablet']
the chormebook works as described by seller .####['chormebook']
however , still 5 stars as you get what you pay for : a cheap , decently rugged , light weight notebook to kick around and tinker with .####['notebook']
love the keyboard .####['keyboard']
i am still getting use to the chromebook but i love it lightweight easy to bring with me as it doesnt take up much room !####['chromebook']
since it is the same platform used at school the navigation was easy to get used too .####['navigation']
another little thing is the speaker isn ' t loud .####['speaker']
great battery life .####['battery life']
battery life , speed , display and software were my additional top reasons why i went for the samsung .####['samsung', 'display', 'battery life', 'software']
the display is crisp and bright , setup literally takes under a minute , its fast , cheap , charges fast , lasts forever .####['display', 'setup']
i love my chromebook .####['chromebook']
it is taking me a while to get used to the small , tight keyboard .####['keyboard']
after researching for a high quality laptop that would not break the bank , i finally chose this one .####['laptop']
delivery was a bit off but i blame usps on that , they suck in my area .####['usps', 'delivery']
amd a12 processor is quite fast when loading everything from an ssd .####['amd a12 processor']
stop what you ' re doing now and get this computer !####['computer']
this computer is the best thing you can get under 400 dollars .####['computer']
great functioning computer .####['computer']
excellent laptop at a reasonable price .####['laptop']
this laptop does all i need it to do .####['laptop']
works flawlessly and decent battery life .####['battery']
excelente laptop####['laptop']
great for graphics , nothing to complex but it can get the job done####['graphics']
love our new laptop .####['laptop']
battery could last longer .####['battery']
light weight , good battery life , sharp screen .####['battery', 'screen']
great performance , quiet and cool processor .####['processor']
the sims 4 ran very smoothly on regular graphics .####['graphics']
i was really excited to get this laptop !####['laptop']
runs first person shooters relatively well .####['first person shooters']
laptop booted right up and the set up waa super easy .####['laptop']
the ones that do , doesn ' t have the numbering pad on the right side of the keyboard and i needed that .####['keyboard']
it ' s a very good lappy and i ' m happy with it , because it can still get all i need to do , done .####['lappy']
for my needs it ' s a perfect computer with one major flaw : battery life is much shorter than they advertise !####['battery life', 'computer']
mine did lose its screen backlight suddenly when i ' d had it less than a month .####['screen']
fast processor .####['processor']
if you want a laptop ( not for gaming - reviews say - i have not tried ) get this one !####['laptop']
i think the battery is just undersized for the amd a12 apu .####['battery']
this is an excellent laptop with a lot of heart .####['laptop']
the dvd player is a really nice touch as well , i didn ' t think i would use it but i definitely will in the future !####['dvd player']
has all the available ports that i need .####['ports']
laptop is very fast with 4cpu and 8gpu on board .####['laptop']
great computer , you can play 2015 and below games on this computer .####['computer']
great laptop !####['laptop']
cpu performance does well .####['cpu']
played heroes of the storm with graphics up full and wasn ' t any lag .####['graphics']
but i guess , it ' s got a lot of power going to that processor so you can ' t have it all .####['processor']
i got ta say this was my first ever online computer / laptop order and let me tell you its pretty good .####['laptop', 'computer']
great feel to the keyboard as well .####['keyboard']
this is a super fast computer and i really like it .####['computer']
it ' s so far a solid laptop that i can use for some gaming and school .####['laptop']
i purchased the laptop in august , and i already have a couple of keys popping off .####['laptop']
i almost always keep it plugged in , so i can ' t comment on battery life .####['battery life']
battery life is short , but plugging it in works .####['battery life']
sleek design .####['design']
nice computer for responsible grade school child .####['computer']
this laptop is well engineered and designed .####['laptop']
this is a very nice laptop .####['laptop']
this laptop is fast and does what i need without problems .####['laptop']
great price and great performance but terrible battery .####['battery']
great computer , setup was fast and easy .####['setup', 'computer']
i am inlove with this laptop literally , it ' s nice size 15 .####['laptop']
graphics are good for the level of this laptop .####['graphics']
finally got the warranty honored after almost 6 months .####['warranty']
plenty of buyer returned it since the touch screen has phantom touch problems right after unboxing or it will eventually happen within 3 months .####['touch screen']
consequently , i am no longer covered and my otherwise great chromebook becomes unusable anytime the phantom touches appear .####['phantom touches', 'chromebook']
i have tried to fix the pixel with online videos and websites with no effect .####['pixel']
the beautiful screen is said to be identical to the pixelbook in size , aspect ratio , and resolution .####['screen']
idk if that ' s how chromeos usually is , or maybe there is something wrong with the hardware but this is very annoying .####['hardware']
the touch screen works wonderfully .####['touch screen']
as others have noted , the backspace key is small .####['backspace key']
my biggest irk today though is that the screen is not very durable .####['screen']
needless to say trip number three to best buy was a pure return , since being 0 / 2 on such an expensive device leaves a bad taste , you know ?####['device']
gorgeous screen , small profile , lightweight , built in stylus , i could go on and on about how awesome this thing was .####['stylus', 'profile', 'screen']
this review might be dismissed as i am missing the ` ` verified purchase ` ` stamp , which is fair .####['verified purchase']
the screen does look good .####['screen']
terrible quality and not really enjoyable to use apps on the playstore .####['apps']
battery life its ok .####['battery life']
another star off for android app support , which simply isn ' t ready for prime time .####['android app support']
i didn ' t find a single android app that was optimized for chrome os ( not that my search was exhaustive , admittedly ) , so was disappointed pretty much every time .####['android app']
battery life was mediocre , too , come to think of it .####['battery life']
amazon gave me the option of returning for refund or trying to have it repaired .####['amazon']
battery is good , display and keyboard are pretty great .####['keyboard', 'battery', 'display']
there ' s nothing ` ` pro ` ` about this tablet .####['tablet']
unless it ' s a really bad baby and chromeos + samsung = bad baby !####['chromeos', 'samsung']
sounds nice until you realize that your computer just doesn ' t let you do things and then calls it secure .####['computer']
the keyboard lacks a backlight which is inconvenient in low light situations .####['keyboard']
when you stack up all these strengths and offer them at a price of $ 299 , you ' re getting a fairly impressive value proposition here with this chromebook .####['chromebook']
this isn ' t say the acer is bad in the abstract ; far from it .####['acer']
it has a nice , oversize trackpad that - like pretty much all chromebooks - is responsive and a pleasure to use .####['trackpad']
the performance never lags , it meets the 10 - 12 hour battery life promise in my usage tests , and it ' s quickly become my go - to computer for both home and work .####['battery life']
this unit not only has a nice aluminum shell ( which is very attractive ) , but it also has a decent keyboard , with much better tactile properties than any chromebooks i ' ve looked at in the past .####['keyboard', 'aluminum shell']
when i was comparing this model against other manufacturer ' s / model ' s , the only thing that made me pause was the lack of a card reader / writer .####['card reader / writer']
this isn ' t a powerhouse , i ' ve never pushed it , it probably wouldn ' t handle the 20 + tabs over multiple windows / desktops that i ' m used to on chrome on the desktop , but for 99 % of ` ` regular people ` ` this is an unbelievably good laptop .####['it']
the battery life is incredible and charges from 0 % to 100 % in about an hour and a half while in use .####['battery life']
little bit of a learning curve with chrome os .####['chrome os']
so it appears the play store does not recognize this devise at this time .####['devise']
chromebook seems like the kind of device that you review after a few weeks , and by the time anything happens to it that affects use , the replacement will be just as much or cheaper , twice as powerful , and come with ` ` angry birds ` ` installed by default .####['chromebook']
the hdmi and usb ports are on the left side , the back has no ports at all , and , misery !####['hdmi and usb ports']
the initial feel for this chromebook is superb .####['chromebook']
the quad - core celeron n3160 gets a respectable near - 8000 octane score .####['quad - core celeron n3160']
this is a solid , well - balanced design .####['design']
first time chromebook user , and this has been my favorite laptop ever .####['laptop']
i ' m been quite pleased at how well the chromebook has worked for all these tasks .####['chromebook']
as for software , chromeos is a decent thin - client operating system which can do more than most people think .####['chromeos']
i was hesitant at first because of the price , but i have to say that this is honestly an amazing machine .####['machine']
secondly , this is a really aesthetically pleasing machine .####['machine']
there are , as with everything , several growth opportunities for this model .####['model']
secondly , the trackpad feels a bit delicate .####['trackpad']
the battery is good .####['battery']
if you are looking for a laptop to check emails , watch movies , to shop , basic documentation , then this is an ideal one .####['laptop']
i have had q & a on this chromebook asking if it will download ms office .####['chromebook']
battery seems to be pretty good .####['battery']
with the slow celeron processor , browsing does not feel snappy .####['celeron processor']
this is my second chromebook and my next purchase will be a chromebase to replace my home pc .####['chromebook']
i ' m a graphic designer / gamer and my creative software operates with no problems and i ' m able to play the sims 4 and world of warcraft on very high settings with no problems at all .####['graphic']
- drives are now solid state drive .####['solid state drive']
- new built - in speakers .####['speakers']

something about os x running with a high resolution display just looks classy in a way that a windows computer could never match .####['display', 'os x']
this computer is blazing fast .####['computer']
with os x yosemite , the os is very refined and elegant .####['os x yosemite', 'os']
the laptop works great and the package was delivered on time .####['laptop', 'package']
this computer is very high quality , do not believe anything on the market can touch it .####['computer']
the backlighting is comparable , but the mbp gets brighter .####['mbp', 'backlighting']
the thunderbolt ports are a nice thing to have on the mbp .####['thunderbolt ports']

loving the sharp display and the track pad .####['display', 'track pad']
i love this macbook .####['macbook']
great product####['product']
this is an amazing computer i bought from cellelectronics .####['computer']
they put a lot of thought and work into making sure that the hardware and software work real well together .####['hardware', 'software']
obviously great computer####['computer']
very nice laptop , i love its portable feature and the running speed is very fast .####['laptop', 'running speed']
the only issue i have with it ( and hence the four star rating ) is the battery life .####['battery life']
awesome computer .####['computer']
the shipping was fast and the seller was great####['shipping', 'seller']
the mac is great besides a chip under the mouse pad .####['chip', 'mac']
the design is beautiful and the force feedback track pad is amazing .####['track pad', 'design']
yeah the new mac book is lighter and only a little small but the internals are a lot slower .####['internals', 'mac book']
love this computer !####['this computer']
force touch trackpad , pretty freakin awesome .####['trackpad']
works like a charm and the retina display is super gorgeous .####['retina display']
i absolutely love the programs that come with it ; how the mac itself functions , the appearance and quality of the mac .####['programs']
battery life thus far isn ' t nearly as long as i thought it would be , based upon video reviews of this model and item description .####['battery life']
this macbook is such a blessing and i would feel somewhat lost without it .####['macbook']
if you ' re considering getting this macbook , proceed with confidence .####['macbook']
the ss hard drive has next to zero lag over traditional drives .####['ss hard drive']
great price and customer service####['customer service']
however , i have an iphone and an ipad and the macbook does a great job syncing up everything on all three devises .####['macbook']
laptop works perfect however i did get a used charger that only lasted a week .####['laptop', 'charger']
awesome machine .####['machine']
costs a few bucks $ $ $ more but apple products are the best on the market .####['apple products']
this computer is great for playing videos in a classroom setting of 10 people , connecting to an hdmi tv to show videos and powerpoints , and has a fantastic battery life .####['battery life', 'computer']
great computer !####['computer']
i ' ve been using this laptop for 1 year and no issues with the deliver nor the computer .####['computer']
great prodcut####['prodcut']
i did not like the new 2016 model due to the lack of ports and magsafe connector .####['2016 model']
shipping was fast and product came as described .####['shipping', 'product']
apple updates are easy .####['apple updates']
high quaility computer in every way .####['computer']
i like this machine quite a bit .####['machine']
i was initially a little nervous as the system was somewhat glitchy for the first couple of weeks , seemed to be a problem with the chrome os because it was fixed by the next update .####['system', 'chrome os because']
screen stays in whatever position you put it solidly enough to use the touchscreen .####['screen']
battery : solid .####['battery']
- speakers are a little tinny ( though the volume is awesome ) and it ' s not possible to customize the equalizer on the chrome os right now : (####['chrome os', 'speakers']
i love that it is only as big as it needs to be to have a full - size keyboard ( not with a number pad , but full - sized keys ) .####['keyboard']
my trusty windows 7 laptop was on its last leg and i opted to try something new .####['windows 7 laptop']
however , it comes with 100 gb of free google drive online storage .####['google drive online storage']
the touchscreen looks good and is responsive , and the keyboard is nice .####['keyboard', 'touchscreen']
people who complain that chromebooks are useless without internet access clearly are narrow minded and simply not thinking outside the box .####['internet access']
so i went to install my favorite screenwriting app , trelby , only to find its not available .####['screenwriting app']
and just like that , i realized that i can use my studio desktop wherever i want , whenever i want .####['studio desktop']
overall : i like it and am happy for paying a bit over $ 200 for the 4gb model ( at the time of writing this , it sells for $ 220 new ) .####['model']
one plus i ' m particularly happy about : a quiet fan - less device that doesn ' t heat up too much !####['fan - less device']
i have to say , i was somewhat hesitant purchasing this chromebook mainly because of some of the reviews .####['chromebook']
due to the excellent return policy on prime i decided to purchase this .####['return policy']
so far all but 1 of the android apps that i have tried have functioned properly , but some are restricted in the size of window that will work properly .####['android apps']
laptop arrived dirty ( grimy screen and there was actual pet hair in the air vent ) .####['laptop', 'screen', 'air vent']
i had to look up keys to press to get into a start up mode to even set up the computer####['computer']
i am not blaming the seller , i am blaming mac ' s os and its glitchy services .####["mac ' s os", 'services', 'seller']
but currently i am happy with it , the battery is ok , and its very aesthetically pleasing .####['battery']
ordered a macbook pro 13inch 256gb from this seller and with the exception of the power button , the keyboard and the trackpad wasn ' t working .####['macbook pro', 'trackpad', 'keyboard', 'power button']
the seller ' s description is that it was ` ` tested and fully functional ` ` and it wasn ' t .####['seller']
update : apparently the laptop sold to me was missing 5 screws on the inside that actually holds everything together .####['laptop']
while yes , the charger does look great coming out of the box , plan on buying another shortly thereafter - and after , as long as your patience holds up .####['charger']
do not waste your time calling apple to see if there is anything they can do about it after 1 year ( unless of course you want to pay even more money on ' apple care ' ) .####['apple']
as much as i love the computer , and tout macbook to all my friends , for me , it stops here and now .####['macbook', 'computer']
the anti - reflective coating will wear off and it isn ' t covered under apple ' s warranty .####["apple ' s warranty", 'anti - reflective coating']

the ` ` ssd drive ` ` is not user replaceable .####['ssd drive ` `']
the charger is defective and after 45 days of use the charger is shot .####['charger']
first impressions , excellent looking laptop and very light !####['laptop']
i love the keyboard and the trackpad - i finally get it now why both of these have rave reviews .####['keyboard', 'trackpad']
the battery life is good - i get about 5 - 6 hours of non stop typing , with 3 browsers opened and wifi always on .####['battery life']
didn ' t purchase from amazon but i can not believe these laptops have 5 stars .####['laptops', 'amazon']
apparently apple isn ' t even trying anymore .####['apple']
* very good battery life####['battery life']
i ' m still absolutely blown away how apple , a supposed industry leader , has such horrendous functionality .####['apple']
i purchased this notebook back in july and was initially happy with my purchase .####['notebook']
after numerous calls , i then received confirmation the warranty was valid , but only as a ‘ one - off ' .####['warranty']
asus , has a horrible reputation .####['asus']
my final verdict - it ' s somewhat solid as a device now that 6 months of updates and delays are behind us .####['device']
bright enough for all uses , and 1080p is perfect - images are sharp .####['1080p']
- battery life is solid , right around what is claimed - probably 7 to 10 hours depending on variables such as screen brightness and how demanding you ' re being with it .####['battery life']
- touchscreen is responsive enough for gaming .####['touchscreen']
i absolutely imagine chrome apps picking up drastically in quality and quantity now , since it seems like chrome os is really coming into its own this year .####['chrome apps']
- in tablet mode , the screen looks too ‘ tall ' to feel natural ( see the attached picture ) .####['screen']
this screen ratio makes it look great in desktop mode .####['screen ratio']
after 3 months of use the unit will no longer charge .####['unit']
if it is indeed a software thing and it ' s fixed , i would highly recommend this device .####['device']
second issue is with scaling of the ui .####['ui']
the screen itself is hd 1080p but most ui elements don ' t look good in this resolution .####['ui elements']
unless the app is specifically designed to access google drive files , the app has no way to read and save files directly to the cloud .####['app']
• great battery life .####['battery life']
i would like a quick fix but have not found one that would allow me to consider keeping this beautiful asus chromebook .####['asus chromebook']
then i one night i plugged it in and woke up to a dead chromebook .####['chromebook']
it ' s too heavy to really use as a tablet .####['tablet']
this product was fantastic - - great build quality , screen resolution , keyboard - - until one day it stopped turning on .####['keyboard', 'build quality', 'product', 'screen resolution']
i ' ve been repairing products for years and it was clear this was a power _ supply issue .####['power _ supply issue']
if this device weren ' t nearly $ 500 i might expect it to only last a year , but at this price point it ' s unacceptable .####['device']
some of the things i wanted to do with this notebook were limited by the os .####['os']
the laptop was great , lightweight , booted fast , simple to use .####['laptop']
even just this last month it still rates ( on several tech sites ) as one of the best overall chromebook lines to get .####['chromebook']
the asus customer service people are rude and have no answers .####['asus customer service people']
this is the problem with companies today .####['companies']
asus customer service sucks .####['asus customer service']
i call customer service , first they argue and say customer damage then to try and placate me they say they have an adp accidental damage and protection plan one time for one year .####['customer service']
it is a beautiful , well built laptop .####['laptop']
that ' s nutty for an expensive premium product .####['product']
asus what the heck were you thinking when you designed this product ?####['asus']
i seriously love the product but i may have to return it .####['product']
now i only leave it charging until it ' s full but the battery time is still decreasing .####['battery']
very impressed with my first chromebook .####['chromebook']
i don ' t use it as much in tablet mode as i thought as it is a little heavy when in that configuration .####['tablet mode']
i had high hopes for this tablet / computer based on customer reviews .####['tablet / computer']
google docs work fine .####['google docs']
a chromebook does most of what i need , except gaiming .####['chromebook']
so , guess i ' m screwed , because now after 6 months my tpm is no longer working and the whole computer is useless .####['tpm', 'computer']
product is sturdy , lightweight , fast , and the battery runtime was as advertised !####['battery runtime', 'product']
i had to buy a mouse because the touchpad is very sticky .####['touchpad']
not at all pleasant to use also , the screen quality is just so - so .####['screen quality']
and not buy any asus product again####['asus product']
i ' ve contacted amazon and asus and no response .####['asus', 'amazon']
this piece of crap won ' t hold a wifi signal or has a really weak signal .####['crap']
several of my chrome extensions perform poorly and have to be disabled altogether which degrades my work production experience .####['chrome extensions']
however , 1 ) the speakers on this thing are horrible .####['speakers']
battery life is not good .####['battery life']
but screen is very weird .####['screen']
the intel m3 processor is amazing , this thing can do a ton of multi - tasking and the google play store is nice to have , the android apps variants trump the chromebook pre - loaded apps .####['google play store', 'intel m3 processor', 'android apps']
a great chromebook , but stopped charging in 3 months .####['chromebook']
i was really excited to purchase this product because it was more affordable .####['product']
chromebooks are cool , but they dont last at all .####['chromebooks']
hey this machine is extremely useable and functionable .####['machine']
battery no longer charging .####['battery']
furthermore , the file system is extremely complicated to use .####['file system']
the display panel on the machine i received is warped .####['display panel on']
the machine looks great from the hardware point , but the whole concept of chrome os and cloud applications sucks .####['chrome os', 'hardware', 'cloud applications', 'machine']
in the middle of using , it rebooted , then went into an endless boot loop , so i tried to reset it to factory default , now it says chrome os is missing or damaged .####['chrome os']
the screen hinge feels weak .####['screen hinge']
screen is average by 2017 standards .####['screen']
the chromebook is brilliant overall .####['chromebook']
google provides zeros customer support related to the os .####['customer support', 'google']
horrible product .####['product']
tech support is no help unless you are willing to part with your computer for months without guarantee of return .####['tech support']
i am having a very difficult time with this chromebook .####['chromebook']
the microphone does not work with regular speaker .####['microphone', 'speaker']
the tablet mode is horribly integrated with the os and applications .####['os', 'applications', 'tablet mode']
this is nothing more than an okay laptop to get you through basic work activities .####['laptop']
overall it ' s one of the nicest chrombooks out there .####['chrombooks']
however , mine came with an annoying trackpad .####['trackpad']
the top metal monitor casing seems to be soft and bendable .####['top metal monitor casing']
mine arrived with the metal screen casing slightly bent , i can easily bend it back , not sure about the durability of this thing in the long term .####['metal screen casing']
however , shortly after i received it , a buzzing sound started coming out of the right side usb port .####['usb port']
so chromebook with some manufacturing issues + bad customer service####['customer service', 'chromebook']
they 1080 screen makes the fonts to small for this size screen .####['screen']
i find the chromium os to be very limiting and would not recommend it over a cheap windows pc .####['windows pc', 'chromium os']
the keyboard is fantastic , but it ' s just a keyboard .####['keyboard']
the touchpad is also some strange off color plastic .####['touchpad']
1 - faulty trackpad resulting in jerky erratic cursor movement relative to the smooth movement of your finger .####['trackpad']
i then noticed a dead pixel on the screen .####['screen']
however , if you want a really speedy chromebook , it ' s great .####['chromebook']
the first unit i received shortly died after a few hours of usage .####['unit']
i like the addition of the cooler boost button , but most of the time i don ' t have to use it because i have a thermaltake auto laptop cooling pad that monitors the bottom surface of my laptop .####['thermaltake auto laptop cooling pad']
trackpad is ok .####['trackpad']
wireless card is finicky with both units i had .####['wireless card']
my laptop seems to lose its internet connection at random times .####['laptop']
after being on the phone with technical support and windows support for a combined 10 hours , i am told that the hardware is defective and must be replaced .####['hardware']
run like heck from this machine .####['machine']
this laptop isn ' t even 30 days old yet .####['laptop']
literally just closing it and opening it up later was a 50 / 50 proposition if it would wake up , or the display would crash , or the disk would crash , or some driver would fail - on a brand new laptop .####['some driver', 'display', 'disk', 'laptop']
hook up the cat5 and the machine is screaming at high speed and exactly what i was hoping for .####['machine']
by the time i was returning it , the system was in such poor shape from the msi .####['system']
i believe if you happen to uninstall / install the drivers in exactly the correct order and / or do a clean win 10 installation yourself , this laptop should perform well for the price .####['laptop']
the sound is really terrible and tinny .####['sound']
excellent product####['product']
i ' ve always liked msi for their performance and fairly decent price .####['msi']
it was actually more like 1h45m and this was also after optimizing the battery .####['battery']
so , four days after buying this laptop , it stopped booting .####['laptop']
this laptop is not worth the time and definitely not the money .####['laptop']
we call tech support together and the guy who answers is just so not interested in helping .####['tech support']
i am extremely disappointed with this laptop .####['laptop']
update : this is by far and away the worst computer i have ever purchased .####['computer']
got the second laptop , died within a month and same thing .####['second laptop']
this kept plaguing the laptop as more problems kept piling up including various bsod errors mostly involving the hardware .####['laptop', 'hardware']
poor design and terrible tech support .####['tech support', 'design']
this computer is amazing !####['computer']
quite like this laptop so far , only writing this review so early from owning it to receive that nice msi headset .####['laptop', 'msi headset']
not too happy with msi , likely to return this laptop .####['laptop', 'msi']
this laptop was great starting out of the box .####['laptop']
their support page is very buggy , and the support people are unhelpful .####['support page', 'support people']
sooooo i would avoid this and i ' m pretty much avoiding the optane drive which may have been part of the issue .####['optane drive']
after this issue i finally decided to return my product .####['product']
good luck this customer tech support and msi has absolutely no idea how to help you .####['msi', 'customer tech support']
you can feel the plastic bending if you pick up the laptop with one hand .####['laptop']
i really loved this laptop .####['laptop']
i will never own another msi product .####['msi product']
now i feel bad buying this for my child , as this laptop seem to have a solid rating elsewhere .####['laptop']
so i ' m stuck with a 3 month old laptop that does n ' t work .####['laptop']
eventually got to the point that even when i reinstalled windows it was so slow that there are clearly serious build defects / instabilities on this product .####['product']
overall a decent laptop if not for these problems , also , the laptop has minor screen freezes even while playing low graphical games like league of legends .####['laptop']
laptop malfunctioned and stopped working after only 3 months .####['laptop']
it does have a nice screen that is very bright , decent viewing angle and ok for contrast .####['screen']
the keyboard is very nice and very responsive .####['keyboard']
i love the fast bootup time with the optane memory , a nice alternative to a very expensive ssd .####['optane memory', 'bootup']
the charge doesn ' t last like the five hours it stated but instead last three hours .####['charge']
as others have said , the only downside is the slow 5400 rpm 1 tb hard drive .####['hard drive']
+ very good ips matte fhd panel , zero reflections , almost zero light bleed , average brightness .####['ips matte fhd panel']
used as bought , it is an ok laptop , but not great ( probably a 3 star value ) .####['laptop']
- no ethernet port ( not that i ' ve used or needed one that i can recall )####['ethernet port']
no backlit keyboard .####['keyboard']
it has plenty of power for most tasks .####['power']
i paid $ 500 for a 15 ` ` notebook with 8gb ram , latest i5 - 8250u cpu with reasonable weight and its quite extendable , i am happy for this deal .####['weight']
also , i ' m not a fan of the delete and power button being next to each other , now i see what the other people are complaining about accidentally shutting it off .####['delete and power button']
very nice looking laptop for the money .####['laptop']
features windows 10 , sharp display , and card slot for m .####['display', 'windows 10', 'card slot']
great quality computer .####['computer']
like the flip , this has good build quality .####['build quality', 'flip']
all in all , pretty good stuff .####['stuff']
2 and this laptop is an epic powerhouse for under $ 700 .####['laptop']
very good laptop if you want something lightweight for everyday browsing .####['laptop']
excellent hardware , however i ran into some nasty trouble after updating windows 10 .####['hardware', 'windows 10']
and just now , the computer says it is plugged in but not charging .####['computer']
the fingerprint reader works most of the time .####['fingerprint reader']
the sound is fine for me but not as good as external speakers .####['external speakers', 'sound']
not that this machine boots up slow .####['boots up', 'machine']
great value for a laptop .####['laptop']
love the 15 inch screen in the body of a 14 inch body .####['15 inch screen']
touchpad works well .####['touchpad']
the speakers are mediocre and don ' t put out too much volume and are sensitive to position .####['speakers']
i do like the screen on this , images are clean and crisp , enjoying the 4 gigs of ram which allow me to have a few more tab open .####['ram', 'screen']
i ' m still keeping this as a backup or additional laptop because of its cheap price .####['laptop']
anyways , i really would of liked to have kept the chromebook as it was the perfect weight , size , and design for my upcoming college semester .####['chromebook']
laptop would never power on , even after being charged for 24 hours .####['laptop']
i want to love this laptop because it is so lightweight and sleek .####['laptop']
ssd hardware issue####['ssd']
note : support for amazon is making it good and immediately sent me the return label , bought through third party but i will get my money back , thank god for amazon customer service####['amazon customer service', 'support for amazon']
the return procedure is so elaborate that i may decide to just write this purchase up as one big mistake .####['return procedure']
they keyboard felt responsive and was a good size .####['keyboard']
i am very close to just returning it and never buying another acer product ever again .####['acer product']
i will give them props for the build quality .####['build quality']
- exceptional keyboard and touchpad feel####['keyboard', 'touchpad']
- below average screen brightness about 200 nits , average is 250 - 275 .####['screen']
when i sent it back to acer to repair it they simply claimed it had water damaging and couldn ' t fix it .####['acer']
my acer aspire e 15 worked great for a day , and then shut off by itself .####['acer aspire']
by june 2018 , the keyboard stopped working , and i had to do an unplug and reboot .####['keyboard']
now given that without the issue they are a nice laptop .####['laptop']
i purchased this computer because it came highly rated by consumer reports , pc magazine , and other raters .####['computer']
the reason why i ' m giving this laptop a two star is because overall i think the quality of it is good especially for the price .####['laptop']
can not remove the battery .####['battery']
i too have the black screen problem .####['screen']
computer is fine but the speakers broke after 1 week of use .####['speakers', 'computer']
the computer is good for the price , but the hdmi port is already broken .####['hdmi port', 'computer']
i want to insist that this is not a game laptop , as many have reviewed it as .####['laptop']
battery life can last me roughly 5 or 6 hours on internet usage alone with multiple tabs .####['battery']
the speakers on the bottom take a moment to get used to but after that it ' s alright .####['speakers']
also , i hate the keyboard - it feels really cheap .####['keyboard']
overall the laptop is cheap and flimsy .####['laptop']
mx150 gaphics card is also pretty bad .####['mx150 gaphics card']
and i genuinely believed in acer , but first i had a lot of issues setting up the computer and after hours of customer service help the touch pad did n ' t even work .####['touch pad']
i took it to my local computer repair who states it has a bad board .####['board']
there ' s something wrong with my laptop .####['laptop']
something is wrong with the power management .####['power management']
very disappointed in the $ 600 e 15 , as opposed to the no frills , plain old , < $ 200 15 i ' ve had for 2 .####['e 15']
the trackpad stopped working after four weeks of using it .####['trackpad']
there is a flicker in the middle of the screen that is very annoying .####['screen']
the computer runs decent but the keypad turns off every time the computer sleeps .####['keypad']
i presented my son with a gift of a defective machine .####['machine']
the computer itself is actually quite fast with the ssd and processor , so my experience there so far has been good .####['processor', 'ssd', 'computer']
keyboard and track pad shoved way left .####['keyboard', 'track pad']
keyboard rattles loudly when typing on left side .####['keyboard']
will not connect to wifi , amd screen flashes when adjusting while on .####['screen', 'wifi']
but the speakers are absolutely horrible !####['speakers']
latest 8th generation core i5 cpu####['8th generation core i5 cpu']
keyboard has flex####['keyboard']
no backlight at keyboard####['backlight', 'keyboard']
key presses are too stiff to press .####['key']
hdd makes this laptop very slow .####['laptop', 'hdd']
but asus engineers designed the case and laptop not to be opened by users .####['laptop', 'case']
there is no backlight and keys are too stiff .####['backlight', 'keys']
i believe it is not healthy to use this keyboard for a long time .####['keyboard']
linux is mostly compatible with this laptop except fingerprint reader .####['fingerprint reader']
video converting process with same video file took only 25 minutes with asus vivobook f510ua .####['asus vivobook f510ua']
3 ) you can hear the screen creak .####['screen']
i will say i do enjoy the screen quality , the wifi is fast on this laptop .####['wifi']
- keyboard is comfortable to use####['keyboard']
- finger doesn ' t side smoothly along track pad .####['track pad']
horrible laptop !####['laptop']
i will never buy an other asus product .####['asus product']
- the screen looks pretty good , except when viewing anything dark .####['screen']
- the keyboard is awful .####['keyboard']
when i asked asus for a replacement key , they said i ' d have to ship it back to them , which would have left me without a computer for 2 weeks .####['asus']
after my 3rd boot up it ' s damaged .####['boot up']
do not buy this computer if your plan is to multitask , play an occasional game and / or play music while searching the web .####['computer']
overall good laptop .####['laptop']
the fingerprint scanner is half jotted and barely works .####['fingerprint scanner']
one day of use and the screen turns itself off and logs you out whenever it feels to do so .####['screen']
finger print scanner not working whatsoever .####['finger print scanner']
with all the great spec hardware in this laptop , why would you put a 5400rpm hard drive in this unit ?####['hardware', 'hard drive', 'spec']
poor touch pad , it get stuck .####['touch pad']
- the physical case is solid and of a production quality you ' d expect in machine 3 - 5x the price of this machine####['production quality']
- user interfaces that are tight , responsive####['user interfaces']
thus far , i ' ve loaded a number of games , my password vault , several productivity apps , skype , spotify and some network scanning android apps and they ' ve all worked very well .####['android apps']
mouse and trackpad settings are very minimalist , there ' s no way to modify short - cut keys , and the power management options are pretty minimal , too .####['mouse', 'power management options', 'trackpad settings']
and the google play store is chock - full of great apps and games .####['google play store', 'apps']
it ' s really seamless and smooth to move back and forth and makes experimenting with different linux configs and environments effortless .####['linux configs', 'environments']
you won ' t be disappointed with this great little machine how ever you end up using it , and that versatility is what really makes this machine such a fun and valuable computer .####['machine', 'computer']
for ~ $ 15 you can get a nice , fitted anti - glare screen protector that reduces the fingerprint / glare problems and gives you some piece of mind about protecting that gorgeous screen .####['screen protector']
i saw this c302 was announced at ces and was immediately drawn to it since it has the intel core m3 processor .####['c302', 'intel core m3 processor']
apps like microsoft word , excel , etc run wonderfully .####['microsoft word', 'excel', 'apps']
for instance , the android youtube app doesn ' t work well at all because it ' s very inconvenient to get videos into full - screen mode .####['android youtube app']
so i ' m very happy and relieved to see it working excellently on the c302 .####['c302']
this is easily the best overall chromebook out there right now ( under $ 500 ) .####['chromebook']
* battery * - battery life is great .####['battery', 'battery life']
the backlight works great and i had no problems using it in the dark .####['backlight']
it ' s a nice smooth surface so no tension when gliding across it .####['surface']

this is finally the chromebook i ' ve been waiting for , that is not a $ 1300 pixel .####['chromebook']
- the screen has great contrast and is glossy and sharp####['screen']
- this may be a personal preference but i did wish the screen was a tad bit brighter .####['screen']
overall great chromebook .####['chromebook']
this is a spectacular chromebook .####['chromebook']
it ' s faster , the screen is much nicer , and it has twice the memory and four times the drive space .####['screen', 'drive space', 'memory']
the core m3 processor allows the c302 to be fanless , as well , adding to the sleek design .####['design']
i find the display sharp and touch responsive to be quite excellent .####['display', 'touch']
- nice , bright screen ( touchscreen , too ! )####['screen', 'touchscreen']
battery doesn ' t last nearly as long as advertised .####['battery']
this is a very cleverly designed and fast machine .####['machine']
operational speed - - likely the fastest laptop i have ever used ( for basic functions ) .####['laptop']
- trackpad isn ' t the best .####['trackpad']
- the touch screen isn ' t as accurate as i wish , for cases like tapping tiny things around the edges .####['touch screen']
- the screen size is an awkward 16 : 9 and provides a 1920x1080 resolution ( although the default is set to 1536x864 ) .####['screen']
for 99 % of the people looking at chromebooks right now for personal use , this asus is probably the best choice in the market .####['asus']
overall , i am extremely impressed with this chromebook and would highly recommend this to others .####['chromebook']
it works well as a tablet .####['tablet']
it works great as a laptop and for the things i do which tend to be web based .####['laptop']
i found the display to be very vibrant , with excellent pixel density .####['display']
i like the dispersion of ports and feel it helps with the ergonomics of your daily usage .####['ports']
still , for $ 450 i ' m a huge fan of the screen and the excellent overall build quality .####['build quality', 'screen']
and even with all of the new competition hitting the market with higher price points , the c302 still offers the best premium chrome os experience at a respectable price .####['c302', 'chrome os']
the screen is fantastic .####['screen']
the mousepad feels very comfortable to use .####['mousepad']
the battery performance is all it ' s cracked up to be .####['battery performance']
the sound is rich and plenty loud enough , but it won ' t replace your music system .####['sound']
backlit allow even guys with large hands to use this keyboard comfortably in any lighting .####['keyboard', 'backlit']
the trackpad and touchscreen are both excellent .####['trackpad', 'touchscreen']
the speaker sound is ok but not great .####['speaker sound']
i really do love this chromebook because it provides a large amount of utility and is perfect for a university setting and environment .####['chromebook']
* the usb - c ports are working well , and i bought a multiple port adapter , which gives me a regular usb port along with a hdmi port an another usb - c port for charging .####['usb - c ports']
speaker : good speakers but not the loudest .####['speakers']
the device is so sturdy and clean looking it is a pleasure to hold in my hands .####['device']
the touchscreen is very responsive and works great in tablet mode .####['touchscreen']
the battery life is touted as 10 hours but i find that 7 .####['battery life']
this is a fantastic chromebook .####['chromebook']
- single battery charge can last 13 - 9 hours depending on wifi / video / app demand####['battery charge']
i love this chromebook .####['chromebook']
the touchscreen works very well , and android apps are working right now if you ' re on the beta channel for chrome os .####['android apps']
i love this chromebook !####['chromebook']
/ / really love this device .####['device']
i really like the keyboard .####['keyboard']
the only drawback to the device so far is that it ' s not especially comfortable to use in tablet mode ; the edges of the bezel are little too ` ` sharp ` ` to comfortably rest your palms and at 2 .####['edges of the bezel']
as a laptop , this is just the size i need .####['laptop']
the keyboard is often - praised , but i don ' t find it particularly spectacular .####['keyboard']
the battery life seems just as promised .####['battery life']
the keyboard is comfortable to type on , although i haven ' t done so for more than a 1 - 2 hours .####['keyboard']
the screen is clear and bright and the system doesn ' t lag unless i have a large number of tabs open .####['screen', 'system']
first , use case : i write a lot for work and use a chromebook as my daily driver for notes , word processing , spreadsheets , etc .####['chromebook']
battery last incredibly long .####['battery']
it found and connected to my wireless printer also with no problems .####['it']
i now feel like this could be my main computer for work and fun .####['computer']
give the asus flip 302 consideration .####['asus flip 302']
its battery life is quite good and the keyboard experience is great .####['keyboard', 'battery life']
the plugs are good and bad .####['plugs']
i plugged in regular headphones and it was horribly low - very unenjoyable to listen to music this way .####['headphones']
nice sized keyboard , works great as a tablet ( even shuts off the keyboard in tablet mode ) .####['keyboard', 'tablet']
this machine is far better than anything i ' ve ever owned .####['machine']
perfect size to use in bed and nice and bright .####['size']
i don ' t think you ' ll find a better laptop at this price point .####['laptop']
the picture quality is very good and the book itself is responsive and fast .####['book', 'picture quality']
i can ' t recommend the asus c302 enough .####['asus c302']
the keyboard itself is probably the one physical weak point .####['keyboard']
the touchscreen works well .####['touchscreen']
sound is really low while using an aux speaker / headphone .####['aux speaker / headphone', 'sound']
spacebar doesn ' t always accept input####['spacebar']
this is my favorite computer of all the ones i have ever owned .####['computer']
the battery life is stunning .####['battery life']
i ' ve just gotten started so this review may evolve over time but after several days i ' m insanely satisfied with this purchase and am going to be showing off to my friends for the foreseeable future .####['purchase']
this chromebook is one of the best computers i ' ve ever used .####['computers', 'chromebook']
the asus chromebook flip 302ca is smooth , fast and incredibly well engineered and built .####['asus chromebook flip 302ca']
the screen resolution is great .####['screen resolution']
the touch pad is accurate .####['touch pad']
my only gripe is that i wish there was a way to default the screen brightness as well as default the keyboard backlight to off .####['keyboard backlight', 'screen brightness']
at a $ 500 price tag for a chromebook i was a little hesitant to pull the trigger but at this point i am very pleased with the purchase and i believe it is worth the price .####['chromebook', 'purchase']
it ' s really nice to have the touchscreen when using apps and i can seamlessly transition back to using the trackpad / keyboard depending on what i ' m doing .####['touchscreen']
keyboard is comfortable and screen is sharp .####['keyboard', 'screen']
its very portable and battery should last full day of normal usage .####['battery']
i truly love this chromebook .####['chromebook']
the touch screen is really accurate , and the 360 flip feature is really easy - i can switch to tablet mode anytime , although i use this much more often as a laptop .####['360 flip']
the pros definitely outweigh the cons , earning this chromebook 5 stars .####['chromebook']
great computer , especially for the price .####['computer']
- two usb - c for charging ( no more odd angles ! )####['usb - c']
- price is a bit expensive for a chromebook####['chromebook']

it feels and performs mighty solid as a laptop .####['laptop']
the wifi connectivity is strong and consistent in my experience .####['wifi connectivity']
the only thing i didn ' t like is the screen isn ' t bright enough and the speakers aren ' t louder .####['screen', 'speakers']
c302ca - dh54 gets the job done for work that doesn ' t require multiple cores for rendering , weight painting or ripping .####['c302ca - dh54']
the graphics are great .####['graphics']
the only drawback is that it does not run the native android versions of microsoft office , and they should warn you about that .####['microsoft office']
this is a small , well built product ideal for general usage .####['product']
the screen resolution is also very good when watching movies or viewing photos .####['screen resolution']
i love the backlight , it ' s not so bright as to blind you at night time .####['backlight']
speaker ' s are ok but not amazing , i do like that they are mounted on the sides so they work well in laptop or tablet mode equally well .####['speaker']
being able to use play store apps has been a huge plus and i ' m now so comfortable with google docs , i ' very already forgotten i even owned a windows laptop .####['google docs']
but this screen is really good and the keyboard and form factor are much better .####['keyboard', 'form factor', 'screen']
i really enjoy the 2 - 1 aspect of the device and really like how when folded into tablet mode , there aren ' t any weird groves on the sides .####['tablet mode']
the computer itself is not bad , the 360 rotation and touch screen feel good .####['touch screen', '360 rotation', 'computer']
battery life is amazing .####['battery life']
in laptop form , it ' s mediocre at best .####['laptop form']
this chromebook is really one of the best you can own , in my opinion one of the best laptops in general !####['chromebook', 'laptops']
the battery life is great and i love the touchscreen / flip feature .####['battery life']
audio quest dragonfly is automatically detected and runs perfectly when attached to one of the usb - c ports .####['usb - c ports']

i love everything about this laptop , the keyboard , screen resolution , and speed .####['laptop', 'screen resolution', 'keyboard']
the battery lasts at least 8 - 9 hours using it to type notes and simple web browsing , making it perfect for students .####['battery']
it is quick , battery lasts a long time and certainly does what i need it to do ( which is web surfing multiple pages at the same time while having a few ms documents open ) .####['battery']
it ' s a clean , mean , lean , machine .####['machine']
the switch has been awesome .####['switch']
the backlit keyboard is awesome at night .####['backlit keyboard']
