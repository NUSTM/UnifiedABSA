this unit is ` ` pretty ` ` and stylish , so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason .####['unit']
for now i ' m okay with upping the experience & device to 3 out of 5 stars .####['device']
this version has been my least favorite version i ' ve had for the following reasons listed bellow the pros .####['version']
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####['track pad']
should not of bought this chromebook .####['chromebook']
after about 5 / 10 minutes of use the screen goes crazy and you have to force to power down and wait to restart .####['screen']
i can not stand the trackpad or the keyboard keys .####['keyboard keys', 'trackpad']
the keyboard is stiff and unresponsive to my typing at times .####['keyboard']
what really did it was when i tried contacting acer support i was simply told ` ` try a restart ` ` and then ` ` call google , we can ' t help you ` ` .####['support']
after some use , the battery charge had logically gone down some ( down to about 80 % ) , and so i went back to my office to plug it in .####['battery']
asus customer support was through chat and cumbersome .####['asus customer support']
the screen is very dim however .####['screen']
the brand new vivobook is dead in the water !####['vivobook']
sounds like a good deal for a $ 620 laptop but battery doesn ' t perform as promised i am hardly getting 4 hrs .####['battery', 'laptop']
screen is amazing####['screen']
thin bezels allow for a compact frame####['bezels']
overall this is a good system for the price and i do recommend the ssd for the price .####['system', 'ssd']
but my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises , both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk .####['fan']
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####['machines', 'asus']
if you can save for 750 - 800 i would recommend going up a bit in the asus line .####['asus']
it seems like there is a problem with the processor because it constantly starts and stops while i ' m trying to surf the web .####['processor']
this computer is loud !####['computer']
i am so disgusted and disheartened by my dealings with asus support , it ' s hard to believe .####['asus support']
this computer has wasted so much of my time already .####['computer']
i do not think i will need to upgrade the ram .####['ram']
acer made a winner here !####['acer']
buy this computer and you ' ll be very happy with it .####['computer']
the ports were another thing that i was really excited to see fully included on a laptop in this price range .####['laptop', 'ports']
i ' ve been happy being able to plug in and run overwatch from time to time on this laptop , with higher settings .####['laptop']
i like that it ' s got the 8th generation i5 cpu .####['8th generation i5 cpu']
dedicated graphics card####['graphics card']
the plastic that borders the screen kind of comes out ever so slightly .####['screen']
it ' s pretty fast for a laptop especially a laptop in this price point .####['laptop']
the picture clarity is amazing and the backlit keyboard is awesome .####['backlit keyboard', 'picture clarity']
overall , this budget laptop ticks all the boxes and there is nothing on the market that is new with so many features crammed in at this price .####['budget laptop']
also love that access to the hd / ssd and ram slots is really easy .####['ram slots', 'hd / ssd']
the bluetooth connects easily to everything .####['bluetooth']
- the battery life is excellent ( i get 6 - 8 hours of normal university student usage out of it ) and even when i ' m using it , it charges as fast as my phone .####['battery life']
- the spacebar is finicky .####['spacebar']
the chromebook has instant connection and a hugely impressive 8 - hour battery life when left on .####['battery life', 'chromebook']
if you are in the google echo system , then this is great .####['google echo system']
a great chromebook at a very reasonable price , includes the google play store .####['chromebook']
this is a functional laptop , perfect for work and casual internet browsing .####['laptop']
great computer and great value , our second chromebook and first one still doing fine just needed another for family .####['computer']
i wanted an inexpensive chromebook and this fit the bill .####['chromebook']
set up is take out of box and open cover .####['set up']
very easy to set up .####['set up']
the chromebook was packaged well and we saw no defects ( ours was used ) .####['chromebook']
it is a basic little laptop and i love it .####['laptop']
linux is a fairly light os depending on the distro you use .####['os', 'linux']
there is a lot of ' bang for your buck ' in the lenovo ideapad 320 .####['lenovo ideapad 320']
low rpm hdd .####['hdd']
excellent laptop good speed on uploads and download .####['laptop']
a good product !####['product']
i ' m using it mainly to store movies , and the 1 tb drive is nice .####['drive']
nice keyboard .####['keyboard']
i have always loved loved the kindles .####['kindles']
my only complaint is that the mouse keypad is a little big .####['mouse keypad']
so , i have had this laptop for almost a week and have put it through the ringer .####['laptop']
only thing i really didn ' t like about this was how quickly the battery drained .####['battery']
if you ' re big on aesthetics then you ' ll love the look .####['look']
i will never use another microsoft program as long as i live .####['microsoft program']
just a home pc laptop that works very well .####['home pc laptop']
very happy with this laptop although not a fan of windows 10 .####['windows 10', 'laptop']
but , until that time , this review stands as : do not buy if your care about the display ' s life .####["display ' s life"]
which is really sad because in the time i could actually use the chromebook i absolutely loved it .####['chromebook']
many apps aren ' t ` ` compatible ` ` and even the ones that work , they look awful .####['apps']
another expensive & poorly executed samsung product .####['samsung product']
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####['screen', 'toshiba', 'build quality']
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####['device']
for home users , these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two - screening , to watching videos and calling family .####['machines']
as a 5 - year chromebook veteran , i ' ve been waiting for this machine .####['machine']
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####['processor']
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####['chromebook']
i was extremely hesitant to buy a used macbook pro ( it ' s still a lot of money ) but so far am surprisingly pleased with it .####['macbook pro']
- new ports that were not in the 2011 model : hdmi port , extra thunderbolt video port ( now it has two instead of one )####['ports']
i had the chance to test the new radeon graphics card and it ' s really good .####['radeon graphics card']
honestly , i think nobody uses these ports anyway .####['ports']
maybe that ' s a consequence of how the retina display is built , but yeah , it ' s harder to keep the screen clean .####['screen']
i do wish the screen were bigger , but i had to go with the 13 ` ` due to budget constraints , so that ' s on me .####['screen']
these macbook pro computers are expensive .####['macbook pro computers']
i think for others they are just buying into the brand .####['brand']
i love the retina display .####['retina display']
i am extremely happy with this laptop .####['laptop']
it doesn ' t effect any of the functionality , but it was a little disappointing to open the box to see a dent on something i ' d just spend $ 1 , 000 on .####['dent']
great product !####['product']
battery issues aside , i really love this laptop and it is easily the nicest piece of electronics i have ever owned .####['battery', 'laptop']
neat and sleek build , great display and very nice os####['display', 'os', 'build']
the new touchpad takes a little getting used to , but otherwise it ' s been perfect .####['touchpad']
the retina screen is amazing .####['retina screen']
less of a fault of the much lauded diving board and more a factor of the very well designed new hardware .####['hardware']
not to mention , the touchbar is just another gimmicky addition to the ` ` future of apple ` ` ( really not as effective as one would think ) .####['touchbar']
a great computer !####['computer']
battery life is a huge plus !####['battery life']
price was very good and met my expectations also shipping was very quick .####['shipping']
my first mac is awesome !####['mac']
this laptop has all the necessary ports .####['laptop']
as i bought 13 inch model , it is very portable .####['model']
overall : i ' m super happy with this product .####['product']
the only drawback is that it only comes with 32 gb of hard drive .####['hard drive']
configuring the printer was a little tricky but not bad .####['printer']
this is where the r11 gets interesting .####['r11']
i have not had any freezing or screen flashing issues .####['screen']
did i mention , i can access all my word , excel , and powerpoint files using the google apps .####['google apps']
i have had it about 4 days and have been checking out how well it runs my favorite android apps .####['android apps']
unfortunately , this particular computer is 100 % unusable after only 2 years and 2 weeks .####['computer']
it is a timeless design and a very respectable screen .####['screen', 'design']
apple has always priced their hardware high , but you could always make an argument for the style , nice hardware and the unique osx experience .####['hardware', 'osx']
* extremely weak graphics card .####['graphics card']
i can ' t use my printer because it ' s not supported .####['printer']
now i ' m just down to some gripes that are probably here to stay : the bluetooth on this thing is really fussy , the non - functional video output ( using usb - c video out through an hdmi cable sends just a blank desktop background and no audio , even if i am playing a movie or youtube visibly on the c302 screen ) , and that it can ' t hold a vpn connection without dropping it every 20 - 30 minutes .####['bluetooth']
sometimes they felt a bit half - baked , but i loved the idea , and the keyboard made a world of difference in what you could do with that tablet .####['keyboard']
- good screen .####['screen']
the funny part is that the customer service people have been great but they have no control to take care of problems .####['customer service']
all metal body , very slim form factor , and has a pretty decent touchscreen .####['factor', 'touchscreen']
anyhow , within a week , the speakers started crackling annoyingly when watching videos , or playing games .####['speakers']
unlike other asus laptops i ' ve tried , this unit won the display roulette .####['unit']
the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####['native chrome os media player']
it also had charging problems and got terrible warranty support .####['warranty support']
i got the same failure to charge issue that others have reported .####['charge']
if bluetooth devices worked with this chromebook it would get 5 stars , but this is the least reliable device in regards to bluetooth i have ever owned .####['chromebook']
i feel like i bought a decent machine but it ' s unable to handle the ram workload .####['machine']
i don ' t think that i was adequately prepared for how dark the screen is at its highest brightness in comparison to other devices .####['screen']
was initially impressed by design but after normal use without any rough handling or dropping of the chromebook , the metal corner tip covering the lcd peels off & warps / bends upwards !####['metal corner tip']
to say i ' m disappointed in this chromebook would be an understatement .####['chromebook']
this computer is really hard to use .####['computer']
it ' s their policy to only repair not replace .####['policy']
+ comfortable keyboard####['keyboard']
decent enough build , but the mouse pad is terrible .####['mouse pad', 'build']
games / video apps perform absolutely awfully .####['games / video apps']
after one charge , the battery would not take charge .####['battery']
i really liked it when i first got it , it performs very well and the software is very easy to use .####['software']
first , the factory default driver configuration of this thing is unstable , which makes installing a correct configuration more difficult .####['factory default driver']
the mouse pad is very touchy , but i use a separate bluetooth mouse anyways .####['mouse pad']
i didn ' t even call for tech help because a brand new laptop should not be giving me such a headache .####['brand new laptop']
the laptop its - self is great and is made of good build quality .####['build quality', 'laptop']
beautiful screen .####['screen']
monitor screen is ok , sometimes the contrast is poor but looks better in games .####['contrast', 'monitor screen']
if i had it to do over again , i would not buy this pc .####['pc']
i would * not * recommend this laptop .####['laptop']
this is the absolute worst laptop i have ever owned .####['laptop']
now , i have been stressed with fixing this laptop since every day has been something new that i need to fix with it .####['laptop']
the overall material the laptop is made of feels incredibly cheap .####['overall material the laptop']
don ' t waste your money on this computer , it will disapoint you in every way possible .####['computer']
the laptop was dead on arrival .####['laptop']
i have had this laptop two months now and it has crashed as many times .####['laptop']
this is the worst laptop i have ever bought in my entire life .####['laptop']
this laptop is small and thin for a 15 .####['laptop']
- keyboard is not that good , i fell that there is uneven uniformity in the button press and travel , and definitely some flex .####['keyboard']
battery life doesn ' t seem to be more than 5 hours , but i expected that going in .####['battery life']
battery charger is super tiny and lightweight , which is an additional advantage vs the 1 lb brick that you have to lug around with the ux501vw .####['battery charger']
most of the laptop is actually very good , but is held back by a 5400 rpm hdd .####['laptop', '5400 rpm hdd']
other than that its components are actually very good .####['components']
the screen looks amazing , ips it seems .####['screen']
loving the laptop .####['laptop']
it ' s light weight , sleek , the screen resolution is great and it runs very well for everyday use .####['screen resolution']
i got this laptop for school and it is simply amazing .####['laptop']
this has been a very light convenient laptop for me .####['laptop']
i have no issues with using the internal hard drive , it works fast enough for me when loading up my software and music .####['internal hard drive']
this little vivo had the speed / storage that we need , the materials feel substantial instead of cheap .####['vivo', 'materials']
love the form factor and the light weight as i often use my laptop while laying down .####['my laptop']
less than that , for me , the screen looks dull .####['screen']
the laptop was shipped in what looked like a new case but upon opening it , it appeared used and repackaged .####['laptop']
had problems with my acer chromebook from the very start .####['acer chromebook']
every few weeks the system locks up and freezes .####['system']
looks like the hdmi port may be defective or something - - another reviewer had a similar problem .####['hdmi port']
before the review this package has nice presentation and solid build .####['package', 'build']
( good ) as for the laptop ( when it worked , and i mean for the whole 30 minutes ) it was extremely fast .####['laptop']
adequate screen .####['screen']
the product looks reasonable at this price range .####['product']
i ' ve only had the computer for a little over a month , that is annoying on many levels .####['computer']
the manufacturer was not helpful in trying to resolve this issue .####['manufacturer']
having ram problems after 1 .####['ram']
i ' ve been able to play fortnite on this laptop , medium settings , with no issues or lag / stutter .####['laptop']
unfortunately i was never able to complete this task , because after booting the laptop it suddenly shut - off on me and wouldn ' t turn back on again .####['laptop']
the wall power adapter charger is not working and then later caught fire .####['wall power adapter charger']
i ' m extremely disappointed with the performance of this laptop .####['laptop']
there are several traps inside and outside of laptop .####['laptop']
keyboard is not good .####['keyboard']
- sleek and nice texture on lid####['lid']
one of the keys is especially flimsy and feels like it could break at any moment .####['one of the keys']
machine is totally unusable during the update .####['machine']
i received the item after 18 days of ordering .####['item']
similarly the task tray area of the main task bar is on the small side and lends itself to fat - fingering .####['task tray area']
one of the features of chromeos that i find very convenient is the way in which all of your configuration settings are stored in the cloud with your gmail account .####['chromeos']
a big part of this device is its gorgeous aesthetic .####['device']
this is a great device and the $ 450 asking price seems fair .####['device']
this computer was 10 fold what i had expected .####['computer']
i ' m usually peaked with ram ( ~ 95 % ) which is good because it ' s better used than not used .####['ram']
quality is excellent so far , and the software / hardware combination works like they were made for each other ( which is what you want : ) )####['software', 'quality', 'hardware']
after a week of use , i can safely say it is the most impressive chromebook i have used to - date .####['chromebook']
update : the c302 now supports google play store services on the stable channel .####['c302']
love this chromebook !####['chromebook']
the screen is plenty bright , and the sound from the speakers is fine for a laptop ( you won ' t be filling a room with sound ) .####['speakers', 'sound']
love the backlit keyboard .####['backlit keyboard']
can get pretty warm running an intensive android app for a while .####['android app']
at least the volume through bluetooth was tolerable .####['volume through bluetooth']
after two years , or almost , the worst thing about this machine is lack of printer support .####['machine']
in general , it has the look and feel of a premium laptop that is at home in any situation such as sitting down with a client .####['laptop']
this is my third chromebook and easily the best i ' ve encountered .####['chromebook']
it ' s lighter , good construction , chromebook works perfectly and downloaded 10 different apps i normally use for free .####['construction', 'chromebook']
battery life is also solid .####['battery life']
construction looks and feels great .####['construction']
on the other hand my least favorite feature is the track pad .####['track pad']
nice screen .####['screen']
easy set up , nice picture , responsive mouse pad , very lightweight , etc .####['mouse pad', 'set up']

cons : no usb ports .####['usb ports']
