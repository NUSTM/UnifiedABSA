oh , and the nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least ( grid autosport fps avg is in the 80s / 90s or so )####['nvidia card']
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####['hd screen']
i have been beyond pleased with this laptop purchase over the last 6 months of use .####['laptop']
additionally , this has a nice backlight to the keyboard , which will turn off when nothing has been pressed for about 20 seconds ( great for when just watching or reading something ) or can be manually turned off entirely .####['keyboard']
- windows 10 ( do i really need to list the drawbacks of 10 ?####['windows 10']
great laptop for expansion and upgrade .####['laptop']
i still find the one piece touch pads unreliable to use even after all the tweaking .####['touch pads']
i will painfully learn the new pads .####['pads']

i wish the camera was a little better , but it ' s great otherwise .####['camera']
the only problem that i have found about lenovo is that it comes with a program called migration , which is supposed to migrate your things from your old computer to your new computer .####['migration']
if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .####['laptop']
price and product , outstanding .####['product']
this device ( and its brother the plus ) has a grave hardware flaw that causes the touchscreen to move on its own .####['hardware', 'touchscreen']
the pixels are currently stuck .####['pixels']
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .####['screen']
i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of keyboards and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .####['keyboards']
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####['chromebook']
there is a power button on the side which i have accidentally hit quite a few times .####['power button']
except , you know , when it decided to become unusable .####['it']
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####['keyboard']
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .####['keyboard']
no caps lock on the keyboard .####['keyboard']
it ' s great in many ways ; the build is solid , the screen is good ( and the resolution is insane ) , and the keyboard is decent , though only time will tell if it ' s as diet coke - resistant as the samsung ' s keys are .####['screen', 'resolution', 'keyboard', 'build']
never has it run out of power while on battery .####['battery']
the 1080p display is very sharp .####['1080p display']

first of all , this is a physically beautiful machine .####['machine']
i purchased this chromebook strictly for writing / editing ( i ' m an independent and published author ) and web browsing .####['chromebook']
losing the function keys for a toucher was a deal breaker .####['function keys']
the keyboard is ok .####['keyboard']
the display is excellent !####['display']
i ventured back to the macbook pro world and purchased this model after much research .####['model']
laptop in perfect condition .####['laptop']
laptop is as described .####['laptop']
it didn ' t come with the box but it came with the charger and so far , i ' ve only been using for a few days , but i have no issues with the item at all .####['item']
the display is amazing and the new force click trackpad is an awesome addition .####['force click trackpad', 'display']
i love this computer .####['computer']
slim , very fast , great screen , lightweight , solid state drives , great battery ( even though it burns the battery life when i play my flight simulator due to processing demands of the graphics ! )####['screen', 'battery']
the pro is by far the best .####['pro']
i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !####['mac']

the display clarity is outstanding .####['display clarity']
it is a great laptop !####['laptop']
one year later and the laptop is still in great condition !####['laptop']
the macbook pro is everything i hoped for and more .####['macbook pro']
works great !####['works']
the retina display is stunning .####['retina display']
i bought this chromebook on the prime day deal , but even without $ 60 off it would still have been worth the money .####['chromebook']
i thought the gizmo was neat but i was disappointed that i couldn ' t really use it the way i wanted to it that regards .####['gizmo']
i could even watch videos and game from the laptop itself ( to an extent ) .####['laptop']
in preparation for becoming a chromebook user i had purchased a 256 gig memory card and moved all my laptop files to it .####['memory card']
every app i have downloaded from the google app store has worked perfectly .####['app']
as it turned out the thunderbolt ports are of no use .####['thunderbolt ports']
the machine looks amazing doesn ' t it !####['machine']

your new retina screen will get stains on it from the top layer seperating and or dead pixels .####['retina screen']
but this asus , who offered so much & rated over 4 stars , turned to a black screen , just over a month after i received it .####['asus']
we ' ve got android nougat on beta running pretty well now .####['android nougat']
the c302 is clean and feels solid .####['c302']
and apparently amazon is experiencing a supply shortage because my replacement isn ' t expected until sometime between jan 11th to feb 5th !####['amazon']
i loved this chromebook , it worked great for six months .####['chromebook']
i also decided that despite the advantages of the asus , i can not live with the sharp edges and middling volume .####['asus']
aluminum outer body , usb c charging from either side of the chrombooke , backit keyboard , nice screen resolution and fast processor .####['processor']
the main bad for this particular variant is that google is no longer going to support it with updates .####['google']
so be forwarded , if you buy this , you are jumping right into a machine that won ' t get updates anymore ( which is something most chromebook owners want and a feature that makes them better than android and it ' s fragmented market ) .####['machine']
it is the nicest chrome computer i have ever owned .####['chrome computer']
the key board and mouse pad are not very sensitive .####['mouse pad', 'key board']
cursor won ' t move and touchscreen won ' t work and from reading about this online i am not alone with this issue .####['cursor', 'touchscreen']
nice screen , nice feel .####['screen']
chromebook is 2 months old and charger stopped working .####['charger']
i still love the laptop , i ' m just a bit disappointed by this and i hope it ' s the only issue i see .####['laptop']
moreover i ' m quite upset because it seems amazon will not pay me back the shipping fees , which for me amount to about 100 $ as i live in france .####['amazon']
i much suspect that google ' s half baked sustem is at fault .####["google ' s half baked sustem"]
the first week i had my chromebook it locked up .####['chromebook']
this product is built well , but it won ' t run the one android app i hoped it would run , and for whatever reason the app and os update download speeds are abysmal .####['app and os update download speeds', 'product']
i loved this chromebook but i had to return it bevause it had sound issues .####['sound', 'chromebook']
but after three charge cycles the screen started vibrating vigorously from side - to - side .####['screen']
manufacturing seems unreliable .####['manufacturing']
the screen is great and the unit is fast .####['screen', 'unit']
everything was good for a few days after receiving the product .####['product']
very disappointing in an otherwise great product####['product']
very fast product , but with this kind of technology it ' s not possible to use a program , that i work ( minitab ) .####['product']
laptop runs really well but fans get a bit loud when gaming####['fans', 'laptop']
it only comes with 8 gb or ram not 16 .####['ram not']
the keys feel nice and responsive however the mouse pad is a little over responsive .####['keys', 'mouse pad']
the monitor looks fantastic , but i still cant get over the fact that you are basically lied to aboit memory availability .####['memory availability', 'monitor']
the computer ' s hardware is decent , but the materials are poor .####["computer ' s hardware", 'materials']
do not buy this computer !####['computer']
cpu and gpu are good , ram is good and i like the keyboard .####['cpu', 'ram', 'keyboard', 'gpu']
its battery life is really good , and the led lights are nice .####['battery life', 'led lights']
- caps lock without a led notification , not so clever .####['caps lock']
quiet keyboard .####['keyboard']
the only thing i don ' t like is that the power button sits beside the delete key .####['power button']
good screen .####['screen']
the screen on this looks great , the bezels aren ' t noticeable .####['screen', 'bezels']
i bought this laptop for software development .####['laptop']
the notebook is very well built and it could easily pass as a high - end machine .####['machine', 'notebook']
only thing i ' d change would be the hard drive .####['hard drive']
purchased this mid november , because of the 8th gen i5 , and other good specs for the great price .####['8th gen i5', 'specs']
what this tells me is that the hdmi port on my chromebook is defective .####['hdmi port on my chromebook']
i can ' t really testify to its battery - life as i have not used it to the point where the battery is totally dissipated .####['battery - life']
i have mixed feelings about this acer chromebook .####['acer chromebook']
now my main complaint is that is it very slow , especially for a new computer !####['computer']
computer was used very little and stopped working after 6 months####['computer']
trackpad keeps breaking .####['trackpad']
the touchpad is quite sensitive i ' ve noticed , not a big issue to me .####['touchpad']
the laptop build is cheap looking and basic , but functional to say the least while i save up money .####['laptop build']
below medium build quality####['build quality']
about 4 hours of battery####['battery']
after the ssd upgrade , the computer is very fast .####['computer', 'ssd']
the hard drive sounds like a distant lawn mower .####['hard drive']
this is a painfully slow computer .####['computer']
- track pad is accurate####['track pad']
also tech support gave incorrect product info !####['tech support']
this computer completely shut down after 2 months .####['computer']
windows 10 alone runs slow on this but once you install some 3rd party programs like adobe photoshop or illistrator , this laptop is unuseable .####['windows 10', 'laptop']
i ' ve been waiting for this chromebook for some time now and having only had it for about two weeks , i can say that the device and purchase were well worth it .####['device', 'chromebook']
the surface texture of the case is a satiny paper - like touch , which is both clean and easy to wipe down , but also not so smooth that you have to be concerned with it slipping out of your hand when carrying it .####['surface texture of the case']
- backlit keyboard rocks####['backlit keyboard']
it was an excellent machine for the money and it also got me spoiled with its touch screen .####['touch screen', 'machine']
the default scaling 1536x864 looks excellent and sharp to me .####['default scaling']
i ' m typing this review in a dark room , and it reminds me how much i love this backlit keyboard .####['backlit keyboard']
again , this is where the build quality really shines .####['build quality']
the addition of the play store puts the device into a sweet spot no other device can come close to matching .####['device']
one , the display is gorgeous ; watching video is a treat .####['display']
the core m3 allows this system to get fast and to stay quiet .####['core m3']
- the keyboard is great and has a nice gentle / quiet click to it .####['keyboard']
the display is perfect for me , plenty of brightness and a decent resolution .####['resolution', 'display']
the usb - c ports are nice and i found that a completely dead battery to fully charged time was about an hour .####['usb - c ports', 'charged time']
* battery - i can not really speak to the battery life yet , but as a power user with lots of tabs and several apps open , it is giving me a days use 5 + hours of use so far .####['battery life']
it ' s one of the best chromebook in the market if not the best .####['chromebook']
i love my c302 !####['c302']
love the keyboard more than its predecessor .####['keyboard']
only problem i have had , which was from the moment i started using it is the audio .####['audio']
nice build quality , very fast and beautiful display .####['build quality', 'display']
the computer itself is sturdy and feels well - made , though the keyboard is a bit smaller than i ' m used to .####['keyboard', 'computer']
i knocked off a star for build quality control .####['build quality control']
the display is clear .####['display']
battery life appears to be pretty good too .####['battery life']
i really like this chromebook .####['chromebook']
this is a great device if your main goal is to check email , surf the internet listen to music or watch videos .####['device']
i have to say that the keyboard is my favorite feature .####['keyboard']
i purchased this machine on cyber monday for $ 375 ( $ 75 off the listing price at the time of this review ) and i think at that price point , it ' s well worth it .####['machine']
the startup time is ridiculously fast , and just opening the laptop will turn it on and get you going on chrome within 10 seconds - i ' ve had as many as 12 tabs open , and it still ran smoothly .####['chrome', 'startup time']
outstanding laptop .####['laptop']
track pad is passable .####['track pad']
so i went ahead and ordered the c302ca , and after a week of use there are no issues to report .####['c302ca']
i like it , good construction , can load android apps .####['construction']
great display .####['display']
the speakers are not great , but bluetooth connection to an external speaker is standard these days and it ' s how we watch movies .####['bluetooth connection']
overall , i am very happy with this purchase , and i am in love with the simplicity of the google ecosystem .####['google ecosystem']
i ' d say the only drawback might be the speakers .####['speakers']
the keyboard is also one of the nicest most comfortable i have ever used .####['keyboard']
overall it has been a wonder experience and quality product .####['product']
the keyboard has excellent travel and just feels right .####['keyboard']
the volume and backlit - keyboard brightness controls also do not work properly .####['volume']
i have to say , this is a very nice product .####['product']
this asus worked right out of the box and was very responsive .####['asus']
i didn ' t want to spend much on this as it is my first laptop , but i was convinced by a few reviews to upgrade to this model as it has more ram and performs better in several areas .####['performs']
an awesome product , well built - well worth your time and money .####['product']
the keyboard is nice to type on .####['keyboard']
