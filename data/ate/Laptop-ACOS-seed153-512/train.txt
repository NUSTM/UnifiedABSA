we ordered this chromebook for my son to use for school .####['chromebook']
when switching between tablet and laptop mode quickly the screen will blink and turn off for an extended period of time before turning back on .####['screen']
it feels like a tablet / computer for a child since it ' s so bulky and heavy .####['tablet', 'computer']
runs good , poor battery life .####['battery life']
to my great dismay and disappointment , the power icon read the exact same message : ` ` plugged in , not charging ` ` .####['power icon']
i ' ve only found 2 other recent reviews of this product that had the same problem ( go ahead and search for them in the reviews ) .####['product']
the built - in speaker is below average .####['built - in speaker']
no backlit keyboard is kinda a bummer but i digress .####['backlit keyboard']
i went with the asus vivobook based on the good specs , better hdd and ram , reviews , and because i could pay for it over several months .####['hdd', 'ram', 'asus vivobook', 'specs']
edit : reinstalled the driver now the audio is better on earphones .####['audio']
with ssd lightning fast start up####['ssd']
no back light keyboard####['keyboard']
i like the laptop for it ' s hardware , and it ' s working properly .####['hardware', 'laptop']
the actual laptop is very much darker and blue .####['actual laptop']
the new computer failed again with the same error .####['computer']
the computer constantly pauses or stutters and then continues when it comes to loading web pages and working on documents .####['computer']
the computer worked well for a few weeks , then the screen backlight died .####['screen backlight', 'computer']
will never buy an asus product again .####['asus product']
no backlighting on the keyboard .####['keyboard']
the fan blows like crazy and it makes so much noise .####['fan']
i would not recommend you buying this laptop , the specs are fine for the price , but the hardware is rubbish .####['hardware', 'laptop', 'specs']
all around , a very lacking laptop .####['laptop']
this computer arrived fine but will not charge .####['computer']
how can a brand new computer not charge properly ?####['computer']
i received this laptop promptly .####['laptop']
i could n ' t have put my feelings about my new acer aspire e 15 e5 - 576g - 5762 better .####['acer aspire e 15 e5 - 576g - 5762']
overall impression : this is a killer laptop for a killer deal !####['laptop']
: p ) , and the machine is definitely zippy .####['machine']
oh , and the nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least ( grid autosport fps avg is in the 80s / 90s or so )####['nvidia card']
+ great and fast cpu and overall fast pc performance####['pc performance', 'cpu']
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####['hd screen']
this laptop is the best for the price in my opinion .####['laptop']
i have been beyond pleased with this laptop purchase over the last 6 months of use .####['laptop']
it is also amazingly quiet : the ssd doesn ' t make any noise , and the fan only spins up if i am doing something intensive like playing games or running a heafty program - just browsing or watching videos / basic office work will not make this computer more than whisper .####['ssd']
additionally , this has a nice backlight to the keyboard , which will turn off when nothing has been pressed for about 20 seconds ( great for when just watching or reading something ) or can be manually turned off entirely .####['keyboard']
in addition , you are gifted with an sd card reader and an optical drive which can read and write cds and dvds ( which i can ' t say i ' ve used other than testing that it worked , but i do remember how hazardous it is to suddenly need something like that and not have it available ) .####['optical drive']
- the keys , often described as mushy , still have a decent click and distance to them .####['keys']
- i swear my screen periodically changes brightness but i can ' t tell if this is my imagination or not .####['screen']
- windows 10 ( do i really need to list the drawbacks of 10 ?####['windows 10']
great laptop for expansion and upgrade .####['laptop']
screen is bright , doesn ' t feel heavy .####['screen']
the screen looks good despite some other reviews .####['screen']
i still find the one piece touch pads unreliable to use even after all the tweaking .####['touch pads']
my first time with a solid state drive , very nice quick and quiet .####['solid state drive']
i will painfully learn the new pads .####['pads']
the screen is more than sufficient for non - gaming , business use , and it seems as fast as expected .####['screen']
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####['ssd']
i have the intel core i7 , soooo fast !####['intel core i7']

google docs are getting so good and user friendly who needs office anymore , content accessible anywhere , just takes a little time to get used to but once you realize all the benefits chromebook is a great choice .####['google docs', 'chromebook']

great computer .####['computer']
this is a brand i look for that i feel i can trust .####['brand']
nice little computer for the price .####['computer']
i wish the camera was a little better , but it ' s great otherwise .####['camera']
it ' s not real fast and it doesn ' t have a lot of storage .####['storage']
i don ' t ask much of a laptop so i am happy with it .####['laptop']
it ' s fast , connects quickly to wifi , and the screen is quite nice .####['screen']
the only problem that i have found about lenovo is that it comes with a program called migration , which is supposed to migrate your things from your old computer to your new computer .####['migration']
no problems with this computer .####['computer']
fast to start up .####['start up']
if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .####['laptop']
runs great - however , i just tried to upload my small adventure videos and the built in video player stops mid video about 10 seconds in - audio continues .####['video player']
i have yet to update the drives on it or try a game but so far its a good machine .####['machine']
price and product , outstanding .####['product']
this device ( and its brother the plus ) has a grave hardware flaw that causes the touchscreen to move on its own .####['hardware', 'touchscreen']
now there are pixels on the screen not working , and they are multiplying .####['screen']
the pixels are currently stuck .####['pixels']
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .####['screen']
no matter where on earth , you can get your apple product repaired .####['apple product']
i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of keyboards and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .####['keyboards']
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####['chromebook']
there is a power button on the side which i have accidentally hit quite a few times .####['power button']
except , you know , when it decided to become unusable .####['it']
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####['keyboard']
you know , i wanted to love this machine .####['machine']
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .####['keyboard']
the cable functions just fine .####['cable']
reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .####['touch screen']
no caps lock on the keyboard .####['keyboard']
samsung sent me a new stylus free of charge and free of hassle , which was nice of them because the top of the oem stylus popped off one day and could not be reassembled .####['stylus', 'oem stylus']
it ' s great in many ways ; the build is solid , the screen is good ( and the resolution is insane ) , and the keyboard is decent , though only time will tell if it ' s as diet coke - resistant as the samsung ' s keys are .####['screen', 'resolution', 'keyboard', 'build']
more importantly i appreciate the uncanny speed to boot up or wake up .####['speed']
never has it run out of power while on battery .####['battery']
the 1080p display is very sharp .####['1080p display']
great device for browsing the internet .####['device']
hulu app is not supported for this computer so you will need to use the browser .####['computer']
i love how slim the design is - will fit easily into my backpack : ) highly recommend for everyday or school use !####['design']
the chrome rdp app also works well , connecting to my windows machines with good performance , and i can access files on my nas using network file shares after using the chromebook for the last couple of weeks , i ' d confidently recommend one for everything but gaming and special purpose applications .####['chrome rdp app', 'chromebook']
battery life is excellent , and i can get several days use before needing to plug in .####['battery life']
with chrome remote desktop i am able to play turn - based video games such as hearthstone or civ 5 while miles away from the computer actually running them .####['chrome remote desktop']
very easy to set up and light to carry .####['set up']
we actually returned the first acer chromebook 14 , we got because the screen would blink randomly and go off .####['screen']
guaranteed excellent customer service !####['customer service']
first of all , this is a physically beautiful machine .####['machine']
i purchased this item 7 months ago and i love it .####['item']
i purchased this chromebook strictly for writing / editing ( i ' m an independent and published author ) and web browsing .####['chromebook']
losing the function keys for a toucher was a deal breaker .####['function keys']
i run windows and linux vms fairly regularly and while i could run them on a comparable windows system , adding windows systems to an already portly windows system has never worked out well for me , so while disappointed in the new upgrades , this 2015 model still rocks vms and does all i need it too for far less $ $ $ .####['the new upgrades']
the keyboard is ok .####['keyboard']
it ' s nice and lightweight , the sd port is useful , and it ' s powerful enough for me to do fairly layer intensive graphic design work in photoshop and basic grading in lightroom .####['sd port']
the keys feel fantastic to type on .####['keys']
the display is excellent !####['display']
i was due to upgrade and this product seemed perfect for me .####['product']
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####['apps', 'chrome', 'google docs / drive']
adobe apps are also power hogs , but that is to be expected .####['adobe apps']
as far as gaming performance , the m370x does quite well .####['m370x']
i ventured back to the macbook pro world and purchased this model after much research .####['model']
but the mac looked and worked great .####['mac']
laptop in perfect condition .####['laptop']
laptop is as described .####['laptop']
it didn ' t come with the box but it came with the charger and so far , i ' ve only been using for a few days , but i have no issues with the item at all .####['item']
i always was a huge fan of apple and i always thought the price on the macbook pros were too steep but i finally took the plunge and i ' m satisfied .####['macbook pros']
the display is amazing and the new force click trackpad is an awesome addition .####['force click trackpad', 'display']
as a refurbished item it was indistinguishable from a new item .####['item']
i love this computer .####['computer']
slim , very fast , great screen , lightweight , solid state drives , great battery ( even though it burns the battery life when i play my flight simulator due to processing demands of the graphics ! )####['screen', 'battery']
the pro is by far the best .####['pro']
the retina screen does an excellent job of not tiring my eyes after a long day of computer work .####['retina screen']
i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !####['mac']
1 - itunes match ( $ 25 / yr i believe ) keeps all of your music synced across all of your ios devices with no limit .####['itunes match']
january 21 , 2016 update : i love this laptop even more than before .####['laptop']
i ' ve only had it for one day and the set up was easy , and all items delivered were present , will update over time !####['set up']
overall , i ' m very happy i chose this model .####['model']
the display clarity is outstanding .####['display clarity']
it is a great laptop !####['laptop']
one year later and the laptop is still in great condition !####['laptop']
the macbook pro is everything i hoped for and more .####['macbook pro']
small light portable , excellent screen , very fast performance and soo quiet , does this have a fan ?####['screen']
fast delivery , brand new as expected .####['delivery']
computer came in good condition and at a good price .####['computer']
works great !####['works']
the retina display is stunning .####['retina display']
i bought this chromebook on the prime day deal , but even without $ 60 off it would still have been worth the money .####['chromebook']
my only complaint is the click on the touchpad feels a little cheap , but i just use ` ` tap to click ` ` so it ' s not an issue .####['touchpad']
when i recieved the item i was amazed at the quality of it .####['item']
i boot it up and notice quickly the display seems to be 720p ( or something close ) but for what i need this thing to do .####['display']
i use some other apps but nothing is quite the same for my workflow .####['apps']
i thought the gizmo was neat but i was disappointed that i couldn ' t really use it the way i wanted to it that regards .####['gizmo']
i could even watch videos and game from the laptop itself ( to an extent ) .####['laptop']
i chose this one mainly because of the full size keyboard , larger screen , and full size hdmi .####['screen', 'hdmi', 'keyboard']
yes , this chromebook comes with the android app store pre - installed .####['chromebook']
although 4 gigs of ram doesn ' t seem like a lot to some of us , because of the simple software , it is very fast with no lag .####['software', 'ram']
the power button is no longer on the keyboard , but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine .####['power button']
in preparation for becoming a chromebook user i had purchased a 256 gig memory card and moved all my laptop files to it .####['memory card']
every app i have downloaded from the google app store has worked perfectly .####['app']
of course , i have only had this acer for a week .####['acer']
as it turned out the thunderbolt ports are of no use .####['thunderbolt ports']
the machine looks amazing doesn ' t it !####['machine']
apple should ashamed to be associated with this cheap , lousy , clearly inferior , plastic nightmare - but then again , maybe that is exactly what they do want , so profits soar .####['apple']
have not heard any complaints about the product .####['product']
your new retina screen will get stains on it from the top layer seperating and or dead pixels .####['retina screen']
but this asus , who offered so much & rated over 4 stars , turned to a black screen , just over a month after i received it .####['asus']
lo and behold , i hadn ' t read quite all of the 1 * reviews : the worst was a teacher who had ordered so many for her several classes and said ` ` i think the problem is with the motherboard .####['motherboard']
we ' ve got android nougat on beta running pretty well now .####['android nougat']
the stock video player misses audio on a lot of movies , and using the vlc app ( android ) is super buggy ( frequently freezes and shuts down ) .####['vlc app', 'stock video player']
the c302 is clean and feels solid .####['c302']
this is now my fastest - charging device .####['device']
i tired every remedy found online , and even got in touch with asus tech support who just said ` ` send it back ` ` .####['asus tech support']
and apparently amazon is experiencing a supply shortage because my replacement isn ' t expected until sometime between jan 11th to feb 5th !####['amazon']
i loved this chromebook , it worked great for six months .####['chromebook']
overall i like the portability and battery life on this device .####['battery life', 'device']
google ' s own services like google docs , drive , and gmail don ' t respond well to touch screen gestures often leaving me in despair .####["google ' s own services"]
• occasionally hangs for 10 - 30 seconds with no response from keyboard or trackpad####['keyboard', 'trackpad']
i also decided that despite the advantages of the asus , i can not live with the sharp edges and middling volume .####['asus']
aluminum outer body , usb c charging from either side of the chrombooke , backit keyboard , nice screen resolution and fast processor .####['processor']
then about 3 months in , it quit charging from the supplied fast charger .####['fast charger']
as of the time of writing , the audio drivers are still not working , but i typically don ' t care for that anyways .####['audio drivers']
the main bad for this particular variant is that google is no longer going to support it with updates .####['google']
so be forwarded , if you buy this , you are jumping right into a machine that won ' t get updates anymore ( which is something most chromebook owners want and a feature that makes them better than android and it ' s fragmented market ) .####['machine']
it is the nicest chrome computer i have ever owned .####['chrome computer']
after about 60 days use the power adapter / charger stopped working .####['power adapter / charger']
- battery sucks .####['battery']
build quality is excellent ( was .####['build quality']
the space bar on the keyboard is inconsistent .####['space bar']
my main gripe is incompatibility with amazon prime videos and gogo .####['amazon prime videos and gogo']
so i call asus customer support , and received some of the worst customer service ever .####['customer service', 'asus customer support']
the key board and mouse pad are not very sensitive .####['mouse pad', 'key board']
cursor won ' t move and touchscreen won ' t work and from reading about this online i am not alone with this issue .####['cursor', 'touchscreen']
this is a great machine in many ways - - and with crouton could run full ubuntu , which made it a great little machine to write code on and deploy to a server .####['machine']
nice screen , nice feel .####['screen']
not super confident this asus unit will last half that long .####['asus unit']
chromebook is 2 months old and charger stopped working .####['charger']
this is exactly what i needed in a laptop .####['laptop']
i still love the laptop , i ' m just a bit disappointed by this and i hope it ' s the only issue i see .####['laptop']
the battery is far below what i expected .####['battery']
moreover i ' m quite upset because it seems amazon will not pay me back the shipping fees , which for me amount to about 100 $ as i live in france .####['amazon']
i much suspect that google ' s half baked sustem is at fault .####["google ' s half baked sustem"]
10 months in my battery will no longer charge .####['battery']
the first week i had my chromebook it locked up .####['chromebook']
this product is built well , but it won ' t run the one android app i hoped it would run , and for whatever reason the app and os update download speeds are abysmal .####['app and os update download speeds', 'product']
and the screen was changing like creazy .####['screen']
i loved this chromebook but i had to return it bevause it had sound issues .####['sound', 'chromebook']
after seven months , the usb - c ports stopped charging .####['usb - c ports']
the screen is nice .####['screen']
but after three charge cycles the screen started vibrating vigorously from side - to - side .####['screen']
the tablet is good also , however can ' t they design something that covers the keyboard during tablet mode .####['tablet']
manufacturing seems unreliable .####['manufacturing']
very touchy touch screen , too sensitive .####['touch screen']
udpate : after talking to tech support , i found out that they made the wrong repair .####['tech support']
the screen is great and the unit is fast .####['screen', 'unit']
everything was good for a few days after receiving the product .####['product']
very disappointing in an otherwise great product####['product']
very fast product , but with this kind of technology it ' s not possible to use a program , that i work ( minitab ) .####['product']
i should have known better : msi has boot issues , no way around it .####['msi']
so far great machine .####['machine']
the battery life is terrible .####['battery life']
not sure it is related , but when i open facebook , aaaallllll the messages open simultaneously .####['facebook']
laptop runs really well but fans get a bit loud when gaming####['fans', 'laptop']
it only comes with 8 gb or ram not 16 .####['ram not']
the keys feel nice and responsive however the mouse pad is a little over responsive .####['keys', 'mouse pad']
the monitor looks fantastic , but i still cant get over the fact that you are basically lied to aboit memory availability .####['memory availability', 'monitor']
the computer ' s hardware is decent , but the materials are poor .####["computer ' s hardware", 'materials']
i am still disastified even if this was a replacement####['replacement']

cpu and gpu are good , ram is good and i like the keyboard .####['cpu', 'ram', 'keyboard', 'gpu']

tech support is useless .####['tech support']
i replug and restarted the laptop 3 times and it still does n ' t work .####['laptop']
had purchase this for my child to surf the net ; i ' d noticed ( and i can easily reproduce the problem ) , whenever her game needs to download an update , it seems like no data is coming down , while the harddrive activity ( read and write ) is very high .####['harddrive activity']
the computer literally blue screened on the second day because system 32 was corrupt .####['system 32', 'computer']
i wouldn ' t recommend this product .####['product']
received this laptop on july 30 , 2018 and by august 5 , 2018 , not even 1 week later , it has stopped working .####['laptop']
- caps lock without a led notification , not so clever .####['caps lock']
the laptop looks beautiful and the 8th gen intel core is a performance powerhouse .####['laptop', '8th gen intel core']
quiet keyboard .####['keyboard']
the only thing i don ' t like is that the power button sits beside the delete key .####['power button']
good screen .####['screen']
ca n ' t go wrong with an asus !####['asus']
the screen on this looks great , the bezels aren ' t noticeable .####['screen', 'bezels']
i bought this laptop for software development .####['laptop']
would have been 5 stars if the keyboard was back light and the finger print reader had linux drivers .####['finger print reader', 'keyboard']
the notebook is very well built and it could easily pass as a high - end machine .####['machine', 'notebook']
only thing i ' d change would be the hard drive .####['hard drive']
display is ok not great .####['display']
don ' t know what was going on , but , it seems like this laptop is working fine .####['laptop']
the computer has been running the programs such as matlab , mathematics , diamond , among others without problem .####['computer']
purchased this mid november , because of the 8th gen i5 , and other good specs for the great price .####['8th gen i5', 'specs']
what this tells me is that the hdmi port on my chromebook is defective .####['hdmi port on my chromebook']
i can ' t really testify to its battery - life as i have not used it to the point where the battery is totally dissipated .####['battery - life']
we ' ll it ' s been a few weeks now with this chromebook now , aside from the initial issue , no problems .####['chromebook']
i have mixed feelings about this acer chromebook .####['acer chromebook']
not only did i get the laptop with a dented corner , the screen constantly flickers and cuts out on occasion , the entire laptop freezes for no discernible reason , and the mouse has completely stopped working twice .####['screen', 'mouse']
now my main complaint is that is it very slow , especially for a new computer !####['computer']
computer was used very little and stopped working after 6 months####['computer']
power cord broke within the first two weeks of use .####['power cord']
trackpad keeps breaking .####['trackpad']
i gave it 3 out of 5 stars , because there is no sd card slot !####['sd card slot']
very disappointed with the wireless radio in this chromebook .####['wireless radio in this chromebook']
overall , worst chromebook ever and i can ' t wait until it dies !####['chromebook']
keys are a bit thin and have an odd feel to them .####['keys']
display driver fails 3x a day .####['display driver']
laptop failed after only six months of use .####['laptop']
the touchpad is quite sensitive i ' ve noticed , not a big issue to me .####['touchpad']
the laptop build is cheap looking and basic , but functional to say the least while i save up money .####['laptop build']
screen broke 2 weeks after having it .####['screen']
battery is not as long####['battery']
the battery life is around 2 hrs , not 10 + as advertised .####['battery life']
below medium build quality####['build quality']
about 4 hours of battery####['battery']
after the ssd upgrade , the computer is very fast .####['computer', 'ssd']
the hard drive sounds like a distant lawn mower .####['hard drive']
this is a painfully slow computer .####['computer']
- track pad is accurate####['track pad']
sound went out in less than a week .####['sound went']
also tech support gave incorrect product info !####['tech support']
this computer completely shut down after 2 months .####['computer']
it ' s one of the worst laptops i ' ve ever had .####['laptops']
this computer freeze , reboots , and crashes in a regular basis if you ' re trying to do multiple stuff at once .####['computer']
the only issue i ' m having is battery life .####['battery life']
windows 10 alone runs slow on this but once you install some 3rd party programs like adobe photoshop or illistrator , this laptop is unuseable .####['windows 10', 'laptop']
i ' ve been waiting for this chromebook for some time now and having only had it for about two weeks , i can say that the device and purchase were well worth it .####['device', 'chromebook']
the surface texture of the case is a satiny paper - like touch , which is both clean and easy to wipe down , but also not so smooth that you have to be concerned with it slipping out of your hand when carrying it .####['surface texture of the case']
- backlit keyboard rocks####['backlit keyboard']
- 4gb ram cap .####['ram']
- boot time , sleep time and wake time are crazy fast .####['boot time', 'wake time', 'sleep time']
it was an excellent machine for the money and it also got me spoiled with its touch screen .####['touch screen', 'machine']
the build quality is nice and the hinge is sturdy .####['hinge', 'build quality']
it ' s much smoother with web pages and android apps , and the touch screen is more responsive .####['android apps', 'web pages', 'touch screen']
the default scaling 1536x864 looks excellent and sharp to me .####['default scaling']
i ' m typing this review in a dark room , and it reminds me how much i love this backlit keyboard .####['backlit keyboard']
again , this is where the build quality really shines .####['build quality']
the addition of the play store puts the device into a sweet spot no other device can come close to matching .####['device']
one , the display is gorgeous ; watching video is a treat .####['display']
i think that the bezels are a smidge thick , but that actually makes perfect sense .####['bezels']
the core m3 allows this system to get fast and to stay quiet .####['core m3']
on a side note , there is a slight defect on my chromebook as there is some creaking and loose feeling when pressing on the bottom left side of my screen , this can be especially annoying in tablet mode .####['screen', 'chromebook']
