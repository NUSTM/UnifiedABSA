this unit is ` ` pretty ` ` and stylish , so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason .####['unit']
for now i ' m okay with upping the experience & device to 3 out of 5 stars .####['device']
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####['track pad']
after about 5 / 10 minutes of use the screen goes crazy and you have to force to power down and wait to restart .####['screen']
i can not stand the trackpad or the keyboard keys .####['trackpad', 'keyboard keys']
what really did it was when i tried contacting acer support i was simply told ` ` try a restart ` ` and then ` ` call google , we can ' t help you ` ` .####['support']
after some use , the battery charge had logically gone down some ( down to about 80 % ) , and so i went back to my office to plug it in .####['battery']

just a home pc laptop that works very well .####['home pc laptop']
many apps aren ' t ` ` compatible ` ` and even the ones that work , they look awful .####['apps']
another expensive & poorly executed samsung product .####['samsung product']
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####['device']
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####['processor']
- new ports that were not in the 2011 model : hdmi port , extra thunderbolt video port ( now it has two instead of one )####['ports']
it doesn ' t effect any of the functionality , but it was a little disappointing to open the box to see a dent on something i ' d just spend $ 1 , 000 on .####['dent']
my first mac is awesome !####['mac']

i can ' t use my printer because it ' s not supported .####['printer']
the funny part is that the customer service people have been great but they have no control to take care of problems .####['customer service']

unlike other asus laptops i ' ve tried , this unit won the display roulette .####['unit']
the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####['native chrome os media player']
it also had charging problems and got terrible warranty support .####['warranty support']
games / video apps perform absolutely awfully .####['games / video apps']
after one charge , the battery would not take charge .####['battery']
first , the factory default driver configuration of this thing is unstable , which makes installing a correct configuration more difficult .####['factory default driver']
the mouse pad is very touchy , but i use a separate bluetooth mouse anyways .####['mouse pad']
the laptop its - self is great and is made of good build quality .####['build quality', 'laptop']
beautiful screen .####['screen']

this laptop is small and thin for a 15 .####['laptop']
looks like the hdmi port may be defective or something - - another reviewer had a similar problem .####['hdmi port']
one of the keys is especially flimsy and feels like it could break at any moment .####['one of the keys']
a big part of this device is its gorgeous aesthetic .####['device']
