- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####['track pad']
should not of bought this chromebook .####['chromebook']

google is expecting to add that in sometime in the next year .####['google']
thankfully , this time , acer has gotten that part right .####['acer']
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####['screen', 'build quality', 'toshiba']
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####['device']
- new ports that were not in the 2011 model : hdmi port , extra thunderbolt video port ( now it has two instead of one )####['ports']
honestly , i think nobody uses these ports anyway .####['ports']
maybe that ' s a consequence of how the retina display is built , but yeah , it ' s harder to keep the screen clean .####['screen']

it is a timeless design and a very respectable screen .####['design', 'screen']
apple has always priced their hardware high , but you could always make an argument for the style , nice hardware and the unique osx experience .####['hardware', 'osx']
* extremely weak graphics card .####['graphics card']
the intel iris sucks .####['intel iris']
sometimes they felt a bit half - baked , but i loved the idea , and the keyboard made a world of difference in what you could do with that tablet .####['keyboard']
anyhow , within a week , the speakers started crackling annoyingly when watching videos , or playing games .####['speakers']
unlike other asus laptops i ' ve tried , this unit won the display roulette .####['unit']
the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####['native chrome os media player']
if i had it to do over , i would not purchase this computer .####['computer']
if bluetooth devices worked with this chromebook it would get 5 stars , but this is the least reliable device in regards to bluetooth i have ever owned .####['chromebook']
i feel like i bought a decent machine but it ' s unable to handle the ram workload .####['machine']

the laptop was dead on arrival .####['laptop']
this is the worst laptop i have ever bought in my entire life .####['laptop']

this computer was 10 fold what i had expected .####['computer']
the screen is really amazing and you can easily change it to 1080p with no issues ( it ' s set lower out of the box ) .####['screen']
love this chromebook !####['chromebook']
the screen is plenty bright , and the sound from the speakers is fine for a laptop ( you won ' t be filling a room with sound ) .####['speakers', 'sound']
can get pretty warm running an intensive android app for a while .####['android app']
after two years , or almost , the worst thing about this machine is lack of printer support .####['machine']
setup was fast and easy , but then again i ' ve been a gmail / gcal / gdocs purist for a while now .####['setup']
it ' s lighter , good construction , chromebook works perfectly and downloaded 10 different apps i normally use for free .####['construction', 'chromebook']
