overall , it is not horrible , but i wouldn ' t purchase this model again .####['model']
- screen feels smaller than other of the same size .####['screen']
6 - inch hd touch , intel celeron n3150 , 4gb ddr3l , 32gb , chrome , cb5 - 132t - c1lk####['chrome', 'cb5 - 132t - c1lk', 'intel celeron n3150', 'hd touch']
the computer constantly pauses or stutters and then continues when it comes to loading web pages and working on documents .####['computer']
should ' ve stick with my pixelbook which was awesome and never have me trouble .####['pixelbook']
i would not recommend you buying this laptop , the specs are fine for the price , but the hardware is rubbish .####['specs', 'hardware', 'laptop']
thanks to its ssd , it boots windows 10 pretty fast , bloatware is kept to a minimum ( please uninstall norton before doing anything else .####['windows 10']
- trackpad is too finicky and not my favorite####['trackpad']
best pc bang for this level of buck .####['pc bang']
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####['ssd']
the screen looks great ( though maybe not if all you do is look at 4k resolution ) and the keyboard response feels pretty good .####['keyboard response', 'screen']
for the price , it ' s a solid laptop .####['laptop']
first time chrome os user , very streamlined and easy to use .####['chrome os']
great price - i always buy the warranty .####['warranty']
this chromebook was one of the best gift to my grandauther .####['chromebook']
so far no problems except i tried to print something from my email and am having trouble linking to my printer .####['printer']
this is a great notebook .####['notebook']
package arrived faster than the estimated arrival .####['package']
the computer has a solid processor and enough memory to handle pretty much anything the average user willl throw at it , short of graphics - heavy gaming .####['memory']
beautiful resolution####['resolution']
you just have to deal with a low battery and that ' s all####['battery']
so before you get angry do your homework on why the laptop may be acting strange .####['laptop']
also can not just ` ` add ` ` memory ddms : only one socket means you must remove the 8gb and purchace a 16gb ( ~ $ 180 further investment ) ; battery not gon na last several hrs , looking at ~ 2 - 4 .####['memory ddms', 'battery']
the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####['start up']
the only draw back with this pc is the battery life which lasts about 3 hrs before needing to be charged .####['battery life']
if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .####['laptop']
i like the size but dislike the battery life .####['battery life']
i will see if samsung honors their warrnty , if so , i will probably change / update this review .####['samsung']
returning it into a standard laptop position did not help , the screen actually turned dark and only closing and opening the lid helped return it to normal state .####['screen']
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####['chromebook']
awesome display .####['display']
mouse track pad is non standard .####['mouse track pad']
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####['device']
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####['stylus']
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .####['display']
certain apps ( especially flash based apps ) will get the machine very hot .####['apps']
the keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice .####['keyboard']
the keys on the keyboard are sunk in a little too low to accommodate for the sleek / thin profile .####['keys on the keyboard are']
overall , the way i see it , i ' m getting a big screen hd android galaxy tablet with a keyboard for the price of a tablet .####['tablet']
while usb - c is cool , a bag full of dongles is not .####['usb - c']
regardless to the fact that the outside box was damaged , the inside box was fine .####['outside box', 'inside box']
mac really knows how to build a good dev laptop####['mac']
condition even better then i expect .####['condition']
the mac works like a new one .####['mac']
overall , i ' m very happy i chose this model .####['model']
well , i have to say , i ' m fairly impressed with my new chrome flipbook !####['chrome flipbook']
not sure what the deal is but extremely disappointed .####['deal']
this is a great computer .####['computer']
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####['device']
i ' ve had mine 10 months and the motherboard has crapped out twice already .####['motherboard']
it just is missing a lot of other features that i wanted in a notebook####['notebook']
vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####['vlc media player']
this is not an inexpensive product , especially for a chrome book but , i figured you get what you pay for .####['product']
after about 60 days use the power adapter / charger stopped working .####['power adapter / charger']
the computer is great , but the charger is garbage .####['charger', 'computer']
android ` ` the computer will recognize your cellphone ` ` system never works .####['system']
sadly after barely a year old it crashes all the time , the touch screen rarely works , and the track pad stops working until a reboot on occasion .####['track pad', 'touch screen']
i will never buy another asus after this experience .####['asus']
i love the way it looks and feels the only thing i can complain about is the fact that none of these electronics come with printed manuels anymore also dont know anything about the camera only see me .####['camera']
the chromebook seems to be working fine now and my daughter does love it .####['chromebook']
second where the heck is my other 8 gigs of ram ?####['8 gigs of ram']
i ' ve never had a computer as fast as this .####['computer']
i definitely recommend this if you are looking for a good gaming laptop .####['laptop']
very good looking and fast laptop if only if it would stop crashing and having to reset back to default settings .####['laptop']
i absolutely love this laptop , it looks great , its quality is amazing and can handle so many games without any lag involved .####['laptop']
i bought this product for black friday and i have been using it steadily since then .####['product']
the battery life on the laptop is disappointing and the webcam doesn ' t work it .####['webcam', 'battery life on the laptop']

highly recommend this laptop for mobile workers .####['laptop']
the screen on this looks great , the bezels aren ' t noticeable .####['screen', 'bezels']
don ' t know what was going on , but , it seems like this laptop is working fine .####['laptop']
i bought the computer on january 2018 and so far i am really enjoying it .####['computer']
purchased this mid november , because of the 8th gen i5 , and other good specs for the great price .####['specs', '8th gen i5']
acer support is awful .####['acer support']
very low quality build and quality support .####['quality build', 'quality support']
this unit is a great compromise between powerful cpu and gpu with good battery life .####['cpu', 'gpu', 'battery life', 'unit']
the screen sits too close to the keyboard and you will end up with scratches on the screen .####['keyboard']
the laptop itself seemed fine at first .####['laptop']
i hate to knock acer as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new product and then not being able to turn it on to use it .####['product', 'acer']
usb ports are too hard to plug and unplug####['usb ports']
the hard drive sounds like a distant lawn mower .####['hard drive']
- the hard drive is really slow and really loud .####['hard drive']
one place that i find lacking in chromeos is the settings management .####['chromeos']
while the stock aluminum case is darn solid enough , it can take scratches easily from things like keys or cable connectors tossed in a bag with it .####['stock aluminum case']
this laptop performs in every way .####['laptop']
- the touchscreen is very responsive , fast , and so far everything has scaled just fine during use####['touchscreen']
the design and style is topnotch .####['design', 'style']
the batrey charges very quickly , you will need 1 hour for a full charge .####['batrey charges']
- backlit keyboard that ' s really quiet ( perfect for in - class typing or library use )####['backlit keyboard']
keyboard has a nice feel to it .####['keyboard']
the keyboard and display quality have always been asus strengths in my experience .####['display']
this chromebook is great system that is lightweight , has excellent battery life , and offers a fantastic keyboard .####['keyboard', 'battery life', 'system', 'chromebook']
this chromebook is awesome .####['chromebook']
the tablet here works well .####['tablet']
the chromebook loads everything lightning fast and provides a simple user experience that gets you where you need to go quickly and efficiently .####['chromebook']
the pricing was too good to pass up and i ' ve really been pleased with the product .####['product']
chrome has come a long way to be sure and in its optimized avatar on this system its very snappy .####['chrome']
the good news is that the android features ( google play store apps ) work nearly across the board .####['android features']
it served my needs of web browsing and word processing for a number of years , but its battery life had dwindled and neither the screen nor the processor can match this asus .####['processor', 'battery life', 'screen']
i absolutely love everything about this chromebook .####['chromebook']
lightweight , gorgeous , great screen / picture quaity , sound could be louder but still good , fast processor ( i do a lot of research , photo processing , netflix watching and reading on the laptop ) .####['processor', 'sound']
- backlit and solid keyboard ( not flimsy or cheap )####['keyboard']
the keyboard is spacious , and has a nice tactile feel .####['keyboard']
the processor is very snappy and will likely never be an issue for anything a normal chromebook user would need it for .####['processor']
i didn ' t want to spend much on this as it is my first laptop , but i was convinced by a few reviews to upgrade to this model as it has more ram and performs better in several areas .####['performs']
