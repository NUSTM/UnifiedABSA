graphic issues : after opening any page or window with a black or dark color and i go back to a more bright or white page it takes at least 5 good second to gain the full luminosity####['graphic']

i would not recommend you buying this laptop , the specs are fine for the price , but the hardware is rubbish .####['hardware', 'laptop', 'specs']
thanks to its ssd , it boots windows 10 pretty fast , bloatware is kept to a minimum ( please uninstall norton before doing anything else .####['windows 10']
oh , and the nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least ( grid autosport fps avg is in the 80s / 90s or so )####['nvidia card']
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####['hd screen']
- trackpad is too finicky and not my favorite####['trackpad']
best pc bang for this level of buck .####['pc bang']
- the backlit keyboard looks nice .####['backlit keyboard']
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####['ssd']
the screen looks great ( though maybe not if all you do is look at 4k resolution ) and the keyboard response feels pretty good .####['screen', 'keyboard response']
for the price , it ' s a solid laptop .####['laptop']
i added an sd card which has expanded on the 16gb of storage .####['sd card']
first time chrome os user , very streamlined and easy to use .####['chrome os']
great price - i always buy the warranty .####['warranty']
this chromebook was one of the best gift to my grandauther .####['chromebook']

lenovo has not disappointed with their products .####['products', 'lenovo']
the computer has a solid processor and enough memory to handle pretty much anything the average user willl throw at it , short of graphics - heavy gaming .####['memory']
it is an okay laptop and nothing more .####['laptop']
beautiful resolution####['resolution']
great item !####['item']
this is actually the first laptop that fitted all my needs , big clear screen , battery life sucks but this is a power house laptop meant to be in one place since its so big , very good computer replacement , amazing sound and screen and very fast .####['screen', 'battery life', 'sound', 'computer replacement']
you just have to deal with a low battery and that ' s all####['battery']
pretty fast processor .####['processor']
so before you get angry do your homework on why the laptop may be acting strange .####['laptop']
also can not just ` ` add ` ` memory ddms : only one socket means you must remove the 8gb and purchace a 16gb ( ~ $ 180 further investment ) ; battery not gon na last several hrs , looking at ~ 2 - 4 .####['battery', 'memory ddms']
the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####['start up']
the only draw back with this pc is the battery life which lasts about 3 hrs before needing to be charged .####['battery life']
for reference : ive had this laptop for about 4 months now for my first year at college .####['laptop']

i will see if samsung honors their warrnty , if so , i will probably change / update this review .####['samsung']
returning it into a standard laptop position did not help , the screen actually turned dark and only closing and opening the lid helped return it to normal state .####['screen']
first and foremost , lets talk about the infamous keyboard .####['keyboard']
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####['chromebook']
i haven ' t abused this at all , and i noticed a small crack in the screen today and it ' s starting to spider out .####['screen']
awesome display .####['display']
mouse track pad is non standard .####['mouse track pad']
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####['device']
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####['stylus']
10 minutes after finishing this review started having a new issue : touch pad started acting out .####['touch pad']
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .####['display']
sent it in , arrived back in an inadequate box ( i shipped it in the oroginal with protective foam came back in the box from samsung w / o any protection ) and 3 days after i recieved the item back the stylus fell apart .####['stylus']
certain apps ( especially flash based apps ) will get the machine very hot .####['apps']

the base model went up in price $ 400 , which excludes any performance benefits .####['base model']

i predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 ( frostbyte 3 engine ) that this machine will perform well with the impending starwars battlefront ( also frostbyte 3 ) .####['machine']
with the windows 10 / directx 12 improvements , frostbite 3 games will do very well on this machine at 1050p graphics / medium / low with the new starwars game .####['machine']

there nwere complaints regarding the lousy screen resolution , as well as the mouse pad not working well .####['screen resolution', 'mouse pad']
not sure what the deal is but extremely disappointed .####['deal']
it turns out that it ' s not a stain , but the anti - reflective coating coming off .####['anti - reflective coating']
ive researched this and it is very common and apple says it ' s normal .####['apple']
this is a great computer .####['computer']
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####['device']
i ' ve had mine 10 months and the motherboard has crapped out twice already .####['motherboard']
it just is missing a lot of other features that i wanted in a notebook####['notebook']
vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####['vlc media player']
this is not an inexpensive product , especially for a chrome book but , i figured you get what you pay for .####['product']
yay amazon customer service they replaced it immediately for me no questions asked .####['amazon customer service']
after about 60 days use the power adapter / charger stopped working .####['power adapter / charger']

however , the speakers are already starting to crackle , and i haven ' t even had the thing for a week .####['speakers']

customer service is difficult .####['customer service']
google play support is lip service only .####['google play support']
hardware is still pretty sound .####['hardware']
keeping the msi software is optional , a few of these are useful like burnrecovery to make a backup of your version of windows just in case anything happens .####['msi software', 'burnrecovery']

acer support is awful .####['acer support']
third time in 5 months that the touchpad became unresponsive .####['touchpad']
very low quality build and quality support .####['quality support', 'quality build']

i called acer tech support but nothing worked .####['acer tech support']
the screen sits too close to the keyboard and you will end up with scratches on the screen .####['keyboard']
when i play a game , there is noise on the screen .####['screen']
the laptop itself seemed fine at first .####['laptop']
i hate to knock acer as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new product and then not being able to turn it on to use it .####['acer', 'product']
i ' ve called apple support numerous times and was never asked if i had the ability to read words as i ' m actually reading words .####['apple support']
the seller doesn ' t reply my e - mails####['seller']
usb ports are too hard to plug and unplug####['usb ports']
i can enjoy the real potential of this laptop .####['laptop']
the hard drive sounds like a distant lawn mower .####['hard drive']
so the audio can easily be muffled .####['audio']
- the hard drive is really slow and really loud .####['hard drive']
replacement ordered and arrived , upon first ten minutes of use the keyboard stops working and is barely functioning sound on max is extremely undesirable .####['keyboard']
- 4gb ram cap .####['ram']
one place that i find lacking in chromeos is the settings management .####['chromeos']

the batrey charges very quickly , you will need 1 hour for a full charge .####['batrey charges']
the screen ' s color gamut is only 50 % ntsc , but as i don ' t perform image editing with it , this hasn ' t mattered .####["screen ' s color gamut"]

this unit is extremely well built .####['unit']
the keyboard is spacious , and has a nice tactile feel .####['keyboard']
