the replacement i got was much better , but still too slow for my expectations .####['replacement']
october 12 , 2017 - - started having trouble maintaining connection to wifi ( spectrum service ) , but usually after several loops re - entering password , connection would be re - established .####['wifi']
now i ' m really bummed that i have a very nice looking chromebook with a beautiful screen that is totally unusable .####['screen', 'chromebook']
i ' ll wait a while until this device gets 4 - 5 stars .####['device']
keyboard key fragile .####['keyboard']
overall , it is not horrible , but i wouldn ' t purchase this model again .####['model']
- screen feels smaller than other of the same size .####['screen']
i already returned the first laptop because i had to press extremely hard to get the left click to work .####['laptop']
the flip and touchscreen aspects work fine , no problems .####['touchscreen', 'flip']
it worked properly for less than a week , and the touch screen stopped functioning again .####['touch screen']
good display####['display']
my understanding is that chromeos is a very light weight so i don ' t know why it lags sometimes with under 10 tabs open and a youtube video playing .####['chromeos']
i tried messing around in the dev mode to adjust the microphone sensitivity but nothing seems to work .####['microphone']
microphone is not really working ( you have to basically yell while alsmost touching it with you lips in order for someone else to hear you ) .####['microphone']
when switching between tablet and laptop mode quickly the screen will blink and turn off for an extended period of time before turning back on .####['screen']
called acer support , they were completely useless .####['acer support']
6 - inch hd touch , intel celeron n3150 , 4gb ddr3l , 32gb , chrome , cb5 - 132t - c1lk####['cb5 - 132t - c1lk', 'chrome', 'hd touch', 'intel celeron n3150']
6 - inch hd touch , intel celeron n3150 , 4gb ddr3l , 32gb , chrome , cb5 - 132t - c1lk####['4gb']
it feels like a tablet / computer for a child since it ' s so bulky and heavy .####['tablet', 'computer']
it appears the adapter may still be good as there are a few sparks when plugging into power but the charging light on the laptop does not come on and the battery is not charging .####['battery', 'charging light', 'adapter']
it was fully charged and i only turned it on a total of 3 times before the screen went blank .####['the screen']
the built - in speaker is below average .####['built - in speaker']
aside from that , laptop seems fine .####['laptop']
no backlit keyboard is kinda a bummer but i digress .####['backlit keyboard']
with this asus i ' m experiencing 2 very disappointing issues .####['asus']
graphic issues : after opening any page or window with a black or dark color and i go back to a more bright or white page it takes at least 5 good second to gain the full luminosity####['graphic']
the m key popped off during initial setup .####['m key']
amazon is 2 - day shipping me a replacement .####['amazon']
camera is sd but not a problem .####['camera']
back lit keyboard should be a standard by now !####['back lit keyboard']
my friends , both female and male , are going to by this set up for their travel needs but for me it is lacking .####['set up']
the computer constantly pauses or stutters and then continues when it comes to loading web pages and working on documents .####['computer']
the laptop does n ' t work .####['laptop']
unable to contact asus support for help .####['asus support']
should ' ve stick with my pixelbook which was awesome and never have me trouble .####['pixelbook']
no backlighting on the keyboard .####['keyboard']
i would not recommend you buying this laptop , the specs are fine for the price , but the hardware is rubbish .####['hardware', 'laptop', 'specs']
* * returning the device - - that unhappy with the item .####['item', 'device']
thanks to its ssd , it boots windows 10 pretty fast , bloatware is kept to a minimum ( please uninstall norton before doing anything else .####['windows 10']
oh , and the nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least ( grid autosport fps avg is in the 80s / 90s or so )####['nvidia card']
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####['hd screen']
- trackpad is too finicky and not my favorite####['trackpad']
- ips full hd screen .####['hd screen']
best pc bang for this level of buck .####['pc bang']
i highly recommend this laptop for anyone looking for a great performing machine with an outstanding price ( just to be clear , it won ' t be running the newest high - end games on ultra - high graphics settings , but it still performs phenomenally for its price range and usage category ) .####['machine', 'laptop']
it is also amazingly quiet : the ssd doesn ' t make any noise , and the fan only spins up if i am doing something intensive like playing games or running a heafty program - just browsing or watching videos / basic office work will not make this computer more than whisper .####['ssd']
- the backlit keyboard looks nice .####['backlit keyboard']
- windows 10 ( do i really need to list the drawbacks of 10 ?####['windows 10']
i will painfully learn the new pads .####['pads']
i ' ve owned several acer monitors that i ' ve always been pleased with , but this is the first computer .####['computer', 'acer monitors']
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####['ssd']
the screen looks great ( though maybe not if all you do is look at 4k resolution ) and the keyboard response feels pretty good .####['screen', 'keyboard response']
for the price , it ' s a solid laptop .####['laptop']
the keyboard is easy to type on ( and the backlight is an added plus ) .####['backlight', 'keyboard']
i added an sd card which has expanded on the 16gb of storage .####['sd card']
chromebooks are light weight and start up immediately and are very easy to use .####['chromebooks']
the keyboard is easy to use , and there is no external noise to contend with .####['keyboard']
the keyboard is nice .####['keyboard']
first time chrome os user , very streamlined and easy to use .####['chrome os']
great price - i always buy the warranty .####['warranty']
fast shipping too !####['shipping']
this chromebook was one of the best gift to my grandauther .####['chromebook']
it is a good product to buy .####['product']
the only problem is that there is no caps lock button on the keyboard .####['caps lock button', 'keyboard']
google docs are getting so good and user friendly who needs office anymore , content accessible anywhere , just takes a little time to get used to but once you realize all the benefits chromebook is a great choice .####['google docs', 'chromebook']
great cheap tool for web development ( using linux ) and everyday internet usage .####['tool']
such a perfect little computer .####['computer']
not happy that the l and the quotation mark key no longer work unless i bang on them .####['l and the quotation mark key']
so far no problems except i tried to print something from my email and am having trouble linking to my printer .####['printer']
we are loving this chromebook !####['chromebook']
this is a great notebook .####['notebook']
i love this little chrome book .####['chrome book']
package arrived faster than the estimated arrival .####['package']
battery works well , i get nearly 4 to 5 hours easily .####['battery']
this item is excellent and not bad for the price .####['item']
love this took place of my laptop .####['laptop']
i bought this for a linux machine and it does that just great .####['linux machine']
lenovo has not disappointed with their products .####['products', 'lenovo']
2 ) the battery was pretty limited .####['battery']
the computer has a solid processor and enough memory to handle pretty much anything the average user willl throw at it , short of graphics - heavy gaming .####['memory']
it is an okay laptop and nothing more .####['laptop']
beautiful resolution####['resolution']
great item !####['item']
right out of the box , this computer is really slow , but two simple steps easily fix that issue .####['computer']
this is actually the first laptop that fitted all my needs , big clear screen , battery life sucks but this is a power house laptop meant to be in one place since its so big , very good computer replacement , amazing sound and screen and very fast .####['screen', 'battery life', 'sound', 'computer replacement']
highly recommend , great value , use computer mainly for online business and is quick and easy to use####['computer']
this laptop is the best of both worlds####['laptop']
very happy with my purchase , fast delivery , package well .####['delivery', 'package']
good laptop .####['laptop']
you just have to deal with a low battery and that ' s all####['battery']
love this computer !####['computer']
pretty fast processor .####['processor']
photoshop also runs very well .####['photoshop']
great service with amazon on fulfilling my order .####['service with amazon']
if you need a decent computer that runs quality this is it , especially if you are starting out .####['computer']
love the price reduction and the lenova one year warranty .####['lenova one year warranty']
laptop meets spec for what it was purchased to do but disappointed it was shipped with a charger not compatible with location it was shipped to ( needed to buy an adapter to convert from 2 pin to 3 pin plug )####['laptop']
plenty of memory and storage .####['memory', 'storage']
so before you get angry do your homework on why the laptop may be acting strange .####['laptop']
great computer .####['computer']
also can not just ` ` add ` ` memory ddms : only one socket means you must remove the 8gb and purchace a 16gb ( ~ $ 180 further investment ) ; battery not gon na last several hrs , looking at ~ 2 - 4 .####['battery', 'memory ddms']
the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####['start up']
8g is enough to do most daily activities , i use nvidia geforce now to play much higher end games like destiny 2 , r6 and what not .####['nvidia geforce']
the only draw back with this pc is the battery life which lasts about 3 hrs before needing to be charged .####['battery life']
otherwise , it ' s a good computer .####['computer']
fantastic computer .####['computer']
for reference : ive had this laptop for about 4 months now for my first year at college .####['laptop']
if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .####['laptop']
youtube works well on here .####['youtube']
easy to use and set up .####['set up']
really happy with this laptop !####['laptop']
price and product , outstanding .####['product']
i like the size but dislike the battery life .####['battery life']
still learning but it ' s a good computer and a great deal####['computer']
i like everything about the device , but the beautiful touchscreen ended up malfunctioning about 6 - months after purchase .####['touchscreen', 'device']
i will see if samsung honors their warrnty , if so , i will probably change / update this review .####['samsung']
returning it into a standard laptop position did not help , the screen actually turned dark and only closing and opening the lid helped return it to normal state .####['screen']
in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this product given the obvious history of quality control issues .####['product']
first and foremost , lets talk about the infamous keyboard .####['keyboard']
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####['chromebook']
i haven ' t abused this at all , and i noticed a small crack in the screen today and it ' s starting to spider out .####['screen']
i just wanted to make it known my personal experiences with the device .####['device']
awesome display .####['display']
mouse track pad is non standard .####['mouse track pad']
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####['device']
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####['stylus']
10 minutes after finishing this review started having a new issue : touch pad started acting out .####['touch pad']
so one star off for the keyboard .####['keyboard']
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .####['display']
i really needed this product for work and had big plans for using it ' s features / versatility .####['product']
all i got was a fancy 2lb metal slab that can only be used to swat flies .####['metal slab']
sent it in , arrived back in an inadequate box ( i shipped it in the oroginal with protective foam came back in the box from samsung w / o any protection ) and 3 days after i recieved the item back the stylus fell apart .####['stylus']
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####['chromeos']
certain apps ( especially flash based apps ) will get the machine very hot .####['apps']
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####['acer chromebook 14']
the keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice .####['keyboard']
the keys on the keyboard are sunk in a little too low to accommodate for the sleek / thin profile .####['keys on the keyboard are']
the keyboard is good .####['keyboard']
the battery life has started to go down after a year of solid use ( still quite good ) , but the quality screen and chromeos make it worth it .####['screen', 'battery life', 'chromeos']
this acer chromebook 14 is by far the best chromebook 300 dollars can buy .####['acer chromebook 14']
the build quality is good ( all aluminum body ) .####['build quality']
the chromebook is quite ideal for those who use their computer mostly for surfing the internet .####['chromebook']
overall , the way i see it , i ' m getting a big screen hd android galaxy tablet with a keyboard for the price of a tablet .####['tablet']
the keyboard is a delight with large , nearly flush , keys set to just the right level of resistance and sensitivity .####['keyboard']
the base model went up in price $ 400 , which excludes any performance benefits .####['base model']
while usb - c is cool , a bag full of dongles is not .####['usb - c']
happy i got a great machine for half the cost !####['machine']
- new radeon graphics card ( finally ! )####['radeon graphics card']
- the screen is harder to clean .####['screen']
in the beginning i felt a little weird about this trackpad .####['trackpad']
the keyboard is ok .####['keyboard']
the click is now provided by a haptic engine and provides more functionality .####['click']
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .####['trackpad']
i ' m not sure when this feature was introduced , but it is very welcome .####['feature']
overall , i feel this is the best laptop i ' ve ever purchased or used .####['laptop']
regardless to the fact that the outside box was damaged , the inside box was fine .####['outside box', 'inside box']
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####['apps', 'chrome', 'google docs / drive']
i predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 ( frostbyte 3 engine ) that this machine will perform well with the impending starwars battlefront ( also frostbyte 3 ) .####['machine']
with the windows 10 / directx 12 improvements , frostbite 3 games will do very well on this machine at 1050p graphics / medium / low with the new starwars game .####['machine']
computer looked excellent .####['computer']
but the mac looked and worked great .####['mac']
it is a small , light , powerful device that until 2016 seemed custom fit for content creators , photographers , and other such lines of work or hobbies .####['device']
has a long battery life .####['battery life']
as of now , highly recommended refurbished products####['products']
well macbook is no less than expected .####['macbook']
this new generation macbook has a fast processor , great retina display , 13 inch high resolution screen , great compatibility and many more .####['screen', 'retina display', 'processor', 'compatibility']
crisp screen .####['screen']
mac really knows how to build a good dev laptop####['mac']
wonderful machine fast , clean , solid i have to said that this guy i fell from my hands the first day i use , goes to the floor and nothing happens screen is perfect and nothing is damage !####['screen', 'machine']
this is my first macbook pro i ' m impress !####['macbook pro']
what an excellent computer .####['computer']
as a refurbished item it was indistinguishable from a new item .####['item']
condition even better then i expect .####['condition']
the mac works like a new one .####['mac']
1 - itunes match ( $ 25 / yr i believe ) keeps all of your music synced across all of your ios devices with no limit .####['itunes match']
this laptop is incredibly lightweight and slim ( ultimately won me over after years of lugging around a whopping 5lb levono ) .####['laptop']
overall , i ' m very happy i chose this model .####['model']
a great laptop !####['laptop']
good quality all around hardware + software , of course that is what apple is known for .####['software', 'hardware', 'apple']
excellent quality and very fast delivery .####['delivery']
if you purchase this product , go into it with realistic expectations and patience getting familiar with the setup and you ' ll probably love it , too !####['product']
well , i have to say , i ' m fairly impressed with my new chrome flipbook !####['chrome flipbook']
i boot it up and notice quickly the display seems to be 720p ( or something close ) but for what i need this thing to do .####['display']
i chose this one mainly because of the full size keyboard , larger screen , and full size hdmi .####['screen', 'hdmi', 'keyboard']
there nwere complaints regarding the lousy screen resolution , as well as the mouse pad not working well .####['screen resolution', 'mouse pad']
not sure what the deal is but extremely disappointed .####['deal']
the laptop is in great physical conditions , no scratches or anything , but certain actions run slowly , specifically any file read or write , like copying a document , uploading an image , creating a new file , etc .####['laptop']
the other weird thing is a ` ` popping ` ` noise i keep getting when i use the tracking pad .####['tracking pad']
it turns out that it ' s not a stain , but the anti - reflective coating coming off .####['anti - reflective coating']
ive researched this and it is very common and apple says it ' s normal .####['apple']
your new retina screen will get stains on it from the top layer seperating and or dead pixels .####['retina screen']
this is a great computer .####['computer']
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####['device']
lo and behold , i hadn ' t read quite all of the 1 * reviews : the worst was a teacher who had ordered so many for her several classes and said ` ` i think the problem is with the motherboard .####['motherboard']
needless to say , android / play rollout is being managed very , very poorly .####['android / play rollout']
for the moment , please note - * * * this product no longer works with the google play store in stable or beta * * * and there is no communication about what we can expect , or when .####['product']
- the m3 processor is * plenty * of power for all chrome , video , and android requirements .####['m3 processor']
i ' ve had mine 10 months and the motherboard has crapped out twice already .####['motherboard']
the build quality is fantastic .####['build quality']
my disappointment begins with the fact that chromeos is not touch - ready and most websites will not consider touch interface for desktop mode websites .####['chromeos']
• bright screen with good colors####['screen']
it just is missing a lot of other features that i wanted in a notebook####['notebook']
vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####['vlc media player']
this is not an inexpensive product , especially for a chrome book but , i figured you get what you pay for .####['product']
yay amazon customer service they replaced it immediately for me no questions asked .####['amazon customer service']
the second one arrived , i had it from end of may june , to september started to notice the a key was a bit unresponsive at times .####['a key']
it has one serious flaw though which is that the audio out can not drive headphones ( or earbuds ) adequately .####['audio out']
after about 60 days use the power adapter / charger stopped working .####['power adapter / charger']
works great as a chromebook but chromebooks are still very limited for android compatibility , at least this one is .####['chromebooks', 'chromebook']
the computer is great , but the charger is garbage .####['charger', 'computer']
the sound and screen quality is low .####['sound', 'screen quality']
android ` ` the computer will recognize your cellphone ` ` system never works .####['system']
sadly after barely a year old it crashes all the time , the touch screen rarely works , and the track pad stops working until a reboot on occasion .####['track pad', 'touch screen']
i will never buy another asus after this experience .####['asus']
oh and the customer service is garbage .####['customer service']
great little machine while it was functioning 100 % .####['machine']
so sad to report that after only a few weeks my asus chromebook has a hairline fracture .####['asus chromebook']
i love the way it looks and feels the only thing i can complain about is the fact that none of these electronics come with printed manuels anymore also dont know anything about the camera only see me .####['camera']
chromebook is 2 months old and charger stopped working .####['charger']
the chromebook seems to be working fine now and my daughter does love it .####['chromebook']
however , the speakers are already starting to crackle , and i haven ' t even had the thing for a week .####['speakers']
i still love the laptop , i ' m just a bit disappointed by this and i hope it ' s the only issue i see .####['laptop']
i opened the box after ordering on black friday , and the machine wouldn ' t charge .####['machine']
customer service is difficult .####['customer service']
however , the resolution could be higher , the scaling is bad , the colors are a bit washy , the weight is off as said earlier , the keys are kinda awkward , travel could be more , and the keys start squeaking soon after use####['keys', 'resolution', 'colors', 'scaling']
the keyboard broke after three months and it has been difficult to get any help from the manufacturer .####['keyboard']
video playback is poor with the amazon prime video player .####['amazon prime video player']
google play support is lip service only .####['google play support']
hardware is still pretty sound .####['hardware']
nice piece but battery holds only 3h - not 10 .####['battery']
the screen is only pretty good .####['screen']
very fast product , but with this kind of technology it ' s not possible to use a program , that i work ( minitab ) .####['product']
cpu and ram were running low .####['cpu', 'ram']
gpu wasn ' t drawing a lot of power because i was playing world of warcraft on the recommended settings .####['gpu']
keeping the msi software is optional , a few of these are useful like burnrecovery to make a backup of your version of windows just in case anything happens .####['msi software', 'burnrecovery']
keyboard problems too .####['keyboard']
msi used to have a driver installer by disk that would install all the proper drivers in the right order , so you ' d have the perfect configuration .####['driver installer']
second where the heck is my other 8 gigs of ram ?####['8 gigs of ram']
the unit is whisper quiet and hasn ' t gotten hot no matter how hard i push it .####['unit']
i ' ve never had a computer as fast as this .####['computer']
bad battery , speaker and touchpad####['battery', 'touchpad', 'speaker']
i don ' t know if i got a defective model or what , but something has gone wrong every time i boot up my computer .####['computer']
keyboard layout is not the best , do not like that i have to press the function key to raise or lower the volume / brightness on the arrow keys .####['keyboard layout is']
this laptop is actually horrible .####['laptop']
the screen would freeze , requiring a hard shutdown .####['screen']
the screen is surprisingly poor .####['screen']
today was my heaviest use of the new computer , and no less than 20 times have i had to undo / unscroll / unselect / unzoom .####['computer']
i definitely recommend this if you are looking for a good gaming laptop .####['laptop']
very good looking and fast laptop if only if it would stop crashing and having to reset back to default settings .####['laptop']
note that this laptop is only 45 daysish old .####['laptop']
cpu and gpu are good , ram is good and i like the keyboard .####['cpu', 'ram', 'keyboard', 'gpu']
port options are nice as well .####['port options']
fans can get loud .####['fans']
this laptop is my first time using the intel optane thing and after this i can not recommend it .####['laptop']
i absolutely love this laptop , it looks great , its quality is amazing and can handle so many games without any lag involved .####['laptop']
its battery life is really good , and the led lights are nice .####['battery life', 'led lights']
i bought this product for black friday and i have been using it steadily since then .####['product']
to bad the battery did n ' t work out .####['battery']
then suddenly it needs a software update which made my laptop crash .####['laptop']
update review : having had this laptop for a few months it has had a bad crash from a recent windows update .####['laptop']
so far the performance has been spectacular !####['performance']
the battery life on the laptop is disappointing and the webcam doesn ' t work it .####['webcam', 'battery life on the laptop']
for the price i paid , this laptop can ' t be beat .####['laptop']
+ the colour is a beautiful grey and not purple as reviewed by other users####['colour']
- power button next to delete button ?####['power button', 'delete button']
horrible keyboard flex####['keyboard flex']
the laptop looks beautiful and the 8th gen intel core is a performance powerhouse .####['laptop', '8th gen intel core']
highly recommend this laptop for mobile workers .####['laptop']
it is fast and lightweight .####['it']
it ' s a good system and has loads of space available for storage :####['storage', 'system']
just one question , now i am running the os on the ssd and the original 1tb harddisk just for storing file , its boot up and start softwares very fast , but operating with file explore is very slow , i already set the file explore not open the quick access but it still slow , rename will effective after seconds , copy file and even right click sometimes need wait for minutes , who know how can i solve it ?####['boot up']
awesome computer .####['computer']
the screen on this looks great , the bezels aren ' t noticeable .####['screen', 'bezels']
the build quality is .####['build quality']
asus support is horrible .####['asus support']
don ' t know what was going on , but , it seems like this laptop is working fine .####['laptop']
i bought the computer on january 2018 and so far i am really enjoying it .####['computer']
purchased this mid november , because of the 8th gen i5 , and other good specs for the great price .####['8th gen i5', 'specs']
screen , i have it running at the brightest setting and looks fine .####['screen']
the hdd sounds more like scraping on tin rather than fine steel .####['hdd']
the trackpad is mediocre in use .####['trackpad']
i can ' t really testify to its battery - life as i have not used it to the point where the battery is totally dissipated .####['battery - life']
unfortunately this chromebook is very sluggish .####['chromebook']
acer support is awful .####['acer support']
third time in 5 months that the touchpad became unresponsive .####['touchpad']
very low quality build and quality support .####['quality support', 'quality build']
the track pad is one of the best i have seen for a non - apple touch pad .####['track pad', 'touch pad']
this unit is a great compromise between powerful cpu and gpu with good battery life .####['cpu', 'unit', 'battery life', 'gpu']
i called acer tech support but nothing worked .####['acer tech support']
the screen sits too close to the keyboard and you will end up with scratches on the screen .####['keyboard']
when i play a game , there is noise on the screen .####['screen']
the laptop itself seemed fine at first .####['laptop']
i hate to knock acer as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new product and then not being able to turn it on to use it .####['acer', 'product']
keyboard lighting is primitive and keeps shutting off .####['keyboard lighting']
i ' ve called apple support numerous times and was never asked if i had the ability to read words as i ' m actually reading words .####['apple support']
thank you to amazon for taking this brick of acer garbage back .####['amazon', 'acer garbage']
the seller doesn ' t reply my e - mails####['seller']
below medium build quality####['build quality']
usb ports are too hard to plug and unplug####['usb ports']
about 4 hours of battery####['battery']
i can enjoy the real potential of this laptop .####['laptop']
the fingerprint sensor is a nice touch and the color and feel of the laptop material is also nice .####['fingerprint sensor', 'laptop material']
15 ` ` screen , full sized keyboard and speed fast enough for some low quality games such as lol .####['speed fast', 'keyboard']
it ' s light and thin , and overall the screen is pretty good .####['screen']
the hard drive sounds like a distant lawn mower .####['hard drive']
so the audio can easily be muffled .####['audio']
- track pad is accurate####['track pad']
- the hard drive is really slow and really loud .####['hard drive']
this computer freeze , reboots , and crashes in a regular basis if you ' re trying to do multiple stuff at once .####['computer']
it ' s a pretty good laptop .####['laptop']
replacement ordered and arrived , upon first ten minutes of use the keyboard stops working and is barely functioning sound on max is extremely undesirable .####['keyboard']
- 4gb ram cap .####['ram']
one place that i find lacking in chromeos is the settings management .####['chromeos']
while the stock aluminum case is darn solid enough , it can take scratches easily from things like keys or cable connectors tossed in a bag with it .####['stock aluminum case']
keyboard is a bit nicer , not tons .####['keyboard']
can ' t say enough about my love of this chromebook .####['chromebook']
the touch screen is super responsive and the keyboard is excellent .####['touch screen', 'keyboard']
the track pad is excellent .####['track pad']
this laptop performs in every way .####['laptop']
- the touchscreen is very responsive , fast , and so far everything has scaled just fine during use####['touchscreen']
and because of the constant usage of higher brightness , the battery does drain faster .####['battery']
other than my hope that it would be light enough to use as a tablet all the time , this is the chromebook i ' ve been wanting for a long time now .####['chromebook']
the design and style is topnotch .####['design', 'style']
the keyboard is fully sized and comfortable , the key travel is good with great action , backlighting is enough and adaptive .####['backlighting', 'keyboard', 'key travel']
- speakers can ` ` chatter ` ` after playing youtube videos for a long period of time .####['speakers']
the one annoyance is that office 365 doesn ' t provide a seamless way to save file offline and sync up when you ' re online .####['office 365']

performance wise , this is an excellent machine - it has a beautiful touchscreen , plenty of storage , converts to a tablet , and seamlessly connects to the google play store to run any of the millions of android apps available .####['storage', 'touchscreen']
sound has been fine , except for a few issues with an android app , and that can easily be software related as android is still in infant stages ( or at least toddler ) on chromebooks , and i expect those quirks will smooth out over time as chromebook software is updated on a very regular basis .####['android app']
android is running flawlessly so far , barring one minor incident with sound on clash of clans ( which went away on reboot ) .####['android']
fast , beautiful display , comfortable keyboard , and the android apps work well ( not great yet , but well ) .####['android apps', 'keyboard', 'display']

it served my needs of web browsing and word processing for a number of years , but its battery life had dwindled and neither the screen nor the processor can match this asus .####['screen', 'battery life', 'processor']
i absolutely love everything about this chromebook .####['chromebook']
please note that the track pad is way better than most .####['track pad']
lightweight , gorgeous , great screen / picture quaity , sound could be louder but still good , fast processor ( i do a lot of research , photo processing , netflix watching and reading on the laptop ) .####['processor', 'sound']
for me the extra storage , back light keyboard ( you ' ll love it ) , 2 in 1 factor , and great build quality made it a no - brainer .####['back light keyboard', 'storage', 'build quality']
- backlit and solid keyboard ( not flimsy or cheap )####['keyboard']
