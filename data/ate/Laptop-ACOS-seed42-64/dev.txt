for now i ' m okay with upping the experience & device to 3 out of 5 stars .####['device']
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####['track pad']
after some use , the battery charge had logically gone down some ( down to about 80 % ) , and so i went back to my office to plug it in .####['battery']

google is expecting to add that in sometime in the next year .####['google']
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####['screen', 'build quality', 'toshiba']
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####['device']
i am extremely happy with this laptop .####['laptop']
however , i have to remove one star for the very unreliable magnetic charging connector .####['charging connector']

the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####['native chrome os media player']
don ' t get me wrong , the device flips back and forth very well .####['device']
to say i ' m disappointed in this chromebook would be an understatement .####['chromebook']
+ comfortable keyboard####['keyboard']
decent enough build , but the mouse pad is terrible .####['mouse pad', 'build']
games / video apps perform absolutely awfully .####['games / video apps']
the mouse pad is very touchy , but i use a separate bluetooth mouse anyways .####['mouse pad']
