this unit is ` ` pretty ` ` and stylish , so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason .####['unit']
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####['track pad']
should not of bought this chromebook .####['chromebook']
the chromebook r 11 was hardly used and only a few months old .####['chromebook r 11']
some apps don ' t work but the play store is still in beta right now####['play store', 'apps']
the screen is very dim however .####['screen']
keyboard is decent with good travel .####['keyboard']
thin bezels allow for a compact frame####['bezels']
but my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises , both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk .####['fan']
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####['machines', 'asus']
it seems like there is a problem with the processor because it constantly starts and stops while i ' m trying to surf the web .####['processor']
buy this computer and you ' ll be very happy with it .####['computer']
this is the best laptop for the price .####['laptop']
i like that it ' s got the 8th generation i5 cpu .####['8th generation i5 cpu']
it boots in seconds although i usually just leave it on constantly .####['boots']
the chromebook has instant connection and a hugely impressive 8 - hour battery life when left on .####['battery life', 'chromebook']
great computer and great value , our second chromebook and first one still doing fine just needed another for family .####['computer']
very easy to set up .####['set up']
it is a basic little laptop and i love it .####['laptop']
there is a lot of ' bang for your buck ' in the lenovo ideapad 320 .####['lenovo ideapad 320']
a good product !####['product']
i ' m using it mainly to store movies , and the 1 tb drive is nice .####['drive']
nice keyboard .####['keyboard']
so , i have had this laptop for almost a week and have put it through the ringer .####['laptop']
if you ' re big on aesthetics then you ' ll love the look .####['look']
i will never use another microsoft program as long as i live .####['microsoft program']
it has a full size keyboard , a number pad , a camera , and great big screen !####['keyboard', 'screen', 'camera', 'number pad']
very happy with this laptop although not a fan of windows 10 .####['windows 10', 'laptop']
many apps aren ' t ` ` compatible ` ` and even the ones that work , they look awful .####['apps']
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####['screen', 'build quality', 'toshiba']
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####['device']
for home users , these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two - screening , to watching videos and calling family .####['machines']
as a 5 - year chromebook veteran , i ' ve been waiting for this machine .####['machine']
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####['processor']
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####['chromebook']
i had the chance to test the new radeon graphics card and it ' s really good .####['radeon graphics card']
honestly , i think nobody uses these ports anyway .####['ports']
maybe that ' s a consequence of how the retina display is built , but yeah , it ' s harder to keep the screen clean .####['screen']
these macbook pro computers are expensive .####['macbook pro computers']
i am extremely happy with this laptop .####['laptop']
the retina screen is amazing .####['retina screen']
not to mention , the touchbar is just another gimmicky addition to the ` ` future of apple ` ` ( really not as effective as one would think ) .####['touchbar']
battery life is a huge plus !####['battery life']
such a nice mac####['mac']
price was very good and met my expectations also shipping was very quick .####['shipping']
this laptop has all the necessary ports .####['laptop']
as i bought 13 inch model , it is very portable .####['model']
the only drawback is that it only comes with 32 gb of hard drive .####['hard drive']
configuring the printer was a little tricky but not bad .####['printer']
my desktop runs all my video editing software for my bigger and most demanding projects and mylaptop is great for editing video and running pc games in places other than my home ( like school ! )####['mylaptop']
i have not had any freezing or screen flashing issues .####['screen']
did i mention , i can access all my word , excel , and powerpoint files using the google apps .####['google apps']
* extremely weak graphics card .####['graphics card']
sometimes they felt a bit half - baked , but i loved the idea , and the keyboard made a world of difference in what you could do with that tablet .####['keyboard']
all metal body , very slim form factor , and has a pretty decent touchscreen .####['factor', 'touchscreen']
anyhow , within a week , the speakers started crackling annoyingly when watching videos , or playing games .####['speakers']
the first issue is that the speakers are on either side of the computer , and you can barely hear them on max volume .####['speakers']
it also had charging problems and got terrible warranty support .####['warranty support']
i got the same failure to charge issue that others have reported .####['charge']
don ' t get me wrong , the device flips back and forth very well .####['device']
was initially impressed by design but after normal use without any rough handling or dropping of the chromebook , the metal corner tip covering the lcd peels off & warps / bends upwards !####['metal corner tip']
it ' s their policy to only repair not replace .####['policy']
other than this , it ' s a decent product .####['product']
i really liked it when i first got it , it performs very well and the software is very easy to use .####['software']
first , the factory default driver configuration of this thing is unstable , which makes installing a correct configuration more difficult .####['factory default driver']
if i had it to do over again , i would not buy this pc .####['pc']
i would * not * recommend this laptop .####['laptop']
now , i have been stressed with fixing this laptop since every day has been something new that i need to fix with it .####['laptop']
the overall material the laptop is made of feels incredibly cheap .####['overall material the laptop']
the laptop was dead on arrival .####['laptop']
i have had this laptop two months now and it has crashed as many times .####['laptop']
this is the worst laptop i have ever bought in my entire life .####['laptop']
other than that its components are actually very good .####['components']
the screen looks amazing , ips it seems .####['screen']
it ' s light weight , sleek , the screen resolution is great and it runs very well for everyday use .####['screen resolution']
moreover , the 8th gen i5 cpu is amazing .####['8th gen i5 cpu']
love the form factor and the light weight as i often use my laptop while laying down .####['my laptop']
less than that , for me , the screen looks dull .####['screen']
if you ' re mainly on youtube or reading stuff online , this chromebook functions well for that purpose .####['chromebook']
the laptop was shipped in what looked like a new case but upon opening it , it appeared used and repackaged .####['laptop']
looks like the hdmi port may be defective or something - - another reviewer had a similar problem .####['hdmi port']
before the review this package has nice presentation and solid build .####['build', 'package']
( good ) as for the laptop ( when it worked , and i mean for the whole 30 minutes ) it was extremely fast .####['laptop']
having ram problems after 1 .####['ram']
the wall power adapter charger is not working and then later caught fire .####['wall power adapter charger']
i ' m extremely disappointed with the performance of this laptop .####['laptop']
there are several traps inside and outside of laptop .####['laptop']
one of the keys is especially flimsy and feels like it could break at any moment .####['one of the keys']
a big part of this device is its gorgeous aesthetic .####['device']
this is a great device and the $ 450 asking price seems fair .####['device']
love this chromebook !####['chromebook']
love the backlit keyboard .####['backlit keyboard']
at least the volume through bluetooth was tolerable .####['volume through bluetooth']
setup was fast and easy , but then again i ' ve been a gmail / gcal / gdocs purist for a while now .####['setup']
this is my third chromebook and easily the best i ' ve encountered .####['chromebook']
it ' s lighter , good construction , chromebook works perfectly and downloaded 10 different apps i normally use for free .####['construction', 'chromebook']
nice screen .####['screen']
i love the keyboard , trackpad and screen .####['keyboard', 'screen', 'trackpad']
the speakers are super clear and get loud enough , but obviously lack bass .####['speakers']
the build quality seems very good .####['build quality']
for ~ $ 400 , i ' m happy with this product after a couple months .####['product']
it ' s fast and the screen is nice .####['screen']
i ' m four months into owning this lean , mean , little machine .####['machine']
the best laptop i have ever owned .####['laptop']
this is a very nice chromebook .####['chromebook']
cons : no usb ports .####['usb ports']
