delete and power button too close to each other and looks the same , i accidentally pressed the power button couple of times .####['power button', 'delete and power button']
i ' m amazed how bad this machine is for the money , and for being described as a ` ` mid - level gamer . ` `####['machine']
no back light keyboard####['keyboard']
not only is it light the battery charger is tiny and with the thin bezels this is a super compact design .####['bezels', 'battery charger', 'design']
the speakers are also not great and the max volume on watching netflix or other videos is rather quite .####['speakers']
the laptop does n ' t work .####['laptop']
battery life is only 3 .####['battery life']
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####['hd screen']
- i swear my screen periodically changes brightness but i can ' t tell if this is my imagination or not .####['screen']

multiple ports for anything you need .####['ports']
it cost 8 dollars and shipping is not cheap .####['shipping']

great laptop for expansion and upgrade .####['laptop']
this computer lives up to its expectations .####['computer']
i have been using a chromebook now for three years and am totally satisfied .####['chromebook']
my old chromebook is an acer and i ' ve had absolutely no problems with it .####['acer']
the only program i couldn ' t find a cloud solution for was scrivener .####['scrivener']
( * cough ' quizlet ' cough * ) i use this hooked up to my mobile hotspot from my cell phone mainly , and it allows me access anywhere i have cell service .####['it']

lenovo computers are of chinese manufacture and thus you will not know if yours is one of the pla ' s cyber - spies .####['lenovo computers']
this is a great laptop for web browsing , skype , and more simple games .####['laptop']
lenovo paid for my shipping to the repair facility since i ' d had it such a short time , and they fixed and returned it in a reasonable time period .####['lenovo']
laptop meets spec for what it was purchased to do but disappointed it was shipped with a charger not compatible with location it was shipped to ( needed to buy an adapter to convert from 2 pin to 3 pin plug )####['laptop']

great laptop if you are willing to put in an ssd and reinstall windows .####['laptop']

it ' s not real fast and it doesn ' t have a lot of storage .####['storage']
great laptop , very quick and efficient for work and casual gaming , got over 200 fps for steam games .####['laptop']
the solution i am trying for now is to disable the touch screen .####['touch screen']
it ' s also worth noting my unit came with a floating trackpad , with initial play before the actually click .####['trackpad']
it is very limited and the competition for an actual usable operating system that can do a lot more than just browse the internet , are available .####['operating system']
apparently there is some optimizations that google has done with the op1 and pixel that allow what is called instant ink .####['google']
horrible , purchased directly from google , dead pixel on arrival , note feature did not pick up stylus and bluetooth rarely worked .####['pixel', 'bluetooth', 'stylus']
chrome os is not matured in any way .####['chrome os']
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####['chromeos']
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .####['acer']
the hardware specs on this are very nice compared to other offerings : 4g ram , 32g storage , quad - core processor , etc .####['hardware specs']
the mouse area is responsive , and has a nice feel to it .####['mouse area']
beautiful ips display .####['ips display']
the keyboard is good .####['keyboard']
but the 4 gb of ram makes the things you use a chromebook for work without delay .####['ram']
where they didn ' t sacrifice is on build quality .####['build quality']

i could not be happier with this computer because i am not the best person with technology .####['computer']
first time users might have a hard time using the keyboard ( some keys like caps lock , pagedown , pageup , delete , home etc are missing , browse the internet to get the equivalent ones ) .####['keyboard']
this acer is a web surfer that ' s easy to travel with .####['acer']
i purchased this item 7 months ago and i love it .####['item']

battery life : i haven ' t had the laptop for too long but easily get 8 hours or more on a charge .####['battery life']
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .####['trackpad']
sure , another generation back was arguably better , but i find this computer to be adequate to my needs right now ( though it is a disappointment that i can ' t upgrade the ram , which definitely limits the lifetime of how long this product will last ) .####['computer']
the overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold .####['design']
and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .####['system']
fantastic computer !####['computer']
the mbp does not run as hot as my old white mb did .####['mbp']

the display clarity is outstanding .####['display clarity']
fast delivery , brand new as expected .####['delivery']
i was super worried that touching the keyboard when it was in tablet mode would cause it to switch back to laptop mode , but it looks like once you move the screen back past like 180 degrees , it goes into full touchscreen .####['keyboard']
my only complaint is the click on the touchpad feels a little cheap , but i just use ` ` tap to click ` ` so it ' s not an issue .####['touchpad']
yes , this chromebook comes with the android app store pre - installed .####['chromebook']
the power button is no longer on the keyboard , but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine .####['power button']
this model has a defect .####['model']
as soon as i turned on the computer , it froze as i tried to sync information .####['computer']

transferring files from a non - iphone phone , like android is extremely annoying .####['android']
paradoxically , this laptop is a ` ` pro ` ` .####['laptop']
this is a great computer .####['computer']
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####['device']
i will update this review when there is further progress - i believe this is a 5 star product but the updates are reducing my confidence in the software .####['software', 'product']
great machine out of the box .####['machine']
the c302 is a great machine .####['c302']
i ' ve had mine 10 months and the motherboard has crapped out twice already .####['motherboard']
my disappointment begins with the fact that chromeos is not touch - ready and most websites will not consider touch interface for desktop mode websites .####['chromeos']
vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####['vlc media player']
many apps won ' t download and work on it like they do on an ellipsis .####['apps']
the one star is for warranty support .####['warranty support']

the computer is great , but the charger is garbage .####['charger', 'computer']
app game ( simpsons tapped out ) ( i know don ' t judge ) lags at every moment .####['app game']
the chromebook seems to be working fine now and my daughter does love it .####['chromebook']
moreover i ' m quite upset because it seems amazon will not pay me back the shipping fees , which for me amount to about 100 $ as i live in france .####['amazon']
i love how i can charge my laptop on both sides of the device .####['laptop', 'device']
i much suspect that google ' s half baked sustem is at fault .####["google ' s half baked sustem"]
10 months in my battery will no longer charge .####['battery']
this product is built well , but it won ' t run the one android app i hoped it would run , and for whatever reason the app and os update download speeds are abysmal .####['app and os update download speeds', 'product']
upon further inspection , i had noticed that one of the side speakers was pushed in and the plastic surrounding it had a crack .####['side speakers']
only three months in , and the laptop won ' t charge .####['laptop']
i loved this chromebook but i had to return it bevause it had sound issues .####['sound', 'chromebook']
i just fear for the long term ruggedness of the exterior .####['exterior']
the screen is good , the tablet mode is nice , and the keyboard has a good feel .####['screen', 'keyboard', 'tablet mode']
this is the worst computer i have ever owned .####['computer']
i ' ve never owned an msi laptop and if i can help it , this one is going back and i will never own one again .####['msi laptop']
keyboard layout is not the best , do not like that i have to press the function key to raise or lower the volume / brightness on the arrow keys .####['keyboard layout is']
in essence , if you want a gaming pc , this one will do the job .####['pc']
do not buy this computer !####['computer']
multiple system crashes .####['system']
so called msi tech support , went through the troubleshooting and of course they could not fix it .####['msi tech support']
this laptop is my first time using the intel optane thing and after this i can not recommend it .####['laptop']

this is a painfully slow computer .####['computer']
after running through the setup wizard , the laptop failed to boot .####['laptop']
it ' s a good enough laptop .####['laptop']
2 stars taken for horrible sound quality####['sound quality']
the only issue i ' m having is battery life .####['battery life']
it has a glassy - smooth surface that resists finger - prints and goop , is very large , and has a firm but not too - clunky feeling click to it .####['surface']
- android apps and google play store are real game changers for the chromeos landscape .####['google play store']
- system settings could be more robust and better organized####['system settings']
d ) a bluetooth mouse - while this unarguably has one of the best trackpads in chromebook land , there are still times you just need the precision of a mouse .####['trackpads']
then the asus flip c302 came into my life :####['asus flip c302']
80 % of the apps it ' s a poor experience .####['apps']
and because of the constant usage of higher brightness , the battery does drain faster .####['battery']
one , the display is gorgeous ; watching video is a treat .####['display']
the speakers get plenty loud , but they start to sound pretty bad when turned up a little past half volume .####['speakers']
- excellent keyboard in all aspects - feel , rigidity , and backlight####['keyboard']
- the build quality is great but not necessarily impressive .####['build quality']
i wish the display was able to go about 1 or 2 clicks brighter and about 1 click darker at the lowest setting .####['display']
surprisingly to me , the tablet form has been better than expected for reading .####['tablet form']
bluetooth to an external speaker is do - able , but not convenient .####['bluetooth', 'speaker']
