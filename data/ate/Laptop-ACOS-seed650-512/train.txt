i ' ll wait a while until this device gets 4 - 5 stars .####['device']
keyboard key fragile .####['keyboard']
i only use the chormebook for surving the internet , checking my email , and watch hulu or netflix .####['chormebook']
so latest update the charger only last about one year and the half .####['charger']
the flip and touchscreen aspects work fine , no problems .####['touchscreen', 'flip']
but you can ' t use an acer chromebook r 11 this way .####['acer chromebook r 11']
we ordered this chromebook for my son to use for school .####['chromebook']
plug - in or usb microphones seem to work fine , so it ' s not a terribly big issue and i don ' t really even use a microphone that often , but it ' s annoying to buy a product and not have it working .####['product']
in addition , in my short time using the device , i realized how much i dislike having fingerprints on my computer screen .####['fingerprints']
good looking laptop but hardware has several major problems .####['hardware', 'laptop']
6 - inch hd touch , intel celeron n3150 , 4gb ddr3l , 32gb , chrome , cb5 - 132t - c1lk####['4gb']
i was very excited at the prospect of buying this laptop .####['laptop']
it appears the adapter may still be good as there are a few sparks when plugging into power but the charging light on the laptop does not come on and the battery is not charging .####['battery', 'charging light', 'adapter']
delete and power button too close to each other and looks the same , i accidentally pressed the power button couple of times .####['power button', 'delete and power button']
i ' m amazed how bad this machine is for the money , and for being described as a ` ` mid - level gamer . ` `####['machine']
no back light keyboard####['keyboard']
not only is it light the battery charger is tiny and with the thin bezels this is a super compact design .####['bezels', 'battery charger', 'design']
i am sure amazon will exchange it again but it is not worth the time and hassle .####['amazon']
the speakers are also not great and the max volume on watching netflix or other videos is rather quite .####['speakers']
the laptop does n ' t work .####['laptop']
battery life is only 3 .####['battery life']
* * returning the device - - that unhappy with the item .####['item', 'device']
i will be returning this item .####['item']
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####['hd screen']
- the battery life is at least 8 hours .####['battery life']
- i swear my screen periodically changes brightness but i can ' t tell if this is my imagination or not .####['screen']
- easily upgradeable hdd ( it comes with a 512 ssd , which is fine for now , but is easily changed out )####['hdd', '512 ssd']
multiple ports for anything you need .####['ports']
decent sized track pad .####['track pad']
it cost 8 dollars and shipping is not cheap .####['shipping']
taking off the entire back of the laptop is very difficult .####['laptop']
i should also mention that i got this laptop when it was 100 dollars off .####['laptop']
great laptop for expansion and upgrade .####['laptop']
this computer lives up to its expectations .####['computer']
hope this review can save others from the initial hassle i endured because the chromebook 3 looks terrific in any other way .####['chromebook 3']
i have been using a chromebook now for three years and am totally satisfied .####['chromebook']
my old chromebook is an acer and i ' ve had absolutely no problems with it .####['acer']
this samsung works as expected and is a good , basic chromebook .####['samsung']
no fans grinding away .####['fans']
the only program i couldn ' t find a cloud solution for was scrivener .####['scrivener']
( * cough ' quizlet ' cough * ) i use this hooked up to my mobile hotspot from my cell phone mainly , and it allows me access anywhere i have cell service .####['it']
, as it doesn ' t have large built in memory .####['memory']
great price - i always buy the warranty .####['warranty']
google is amazing .####['google']
i ' m using this device to run a small etsy business and its perfect for my needs .####['device']
although lightweight and less expensive , the lack of sensitivity of the touchpad makes using this with ease kind of frustrating .####['touchpad']
the battery will last a full day or two so it ' s very good for a middle school student .####['battery']
such a perfect little computer .####['computer']
original order arrived with damaged screen ; however , i contacted amazon and 2 days later i had the replacement .####['screen', 'amazon']
i bought this for a light user and it seems like the chrome os is going to work well for her - simple and quick .####['chrome os']
i ' m satisfied with the product .####['product']
very satisfied with simplicity of use , the streamlining of the google products , and the considerable battery life .####['google products', 'battery life']
daughter school uses chrome for everything .####['chrome']
i love this little chrome book .####['chrome book']
package arrived faster than the estimated arrival .####['package']
solid chromebook .####['chromebook']
i love my laptop !####['laptop']
surprisingly fast for such a small chrome book .####['chrome book']
i bought this for a linux machine and it does that just great .####['linux machine']
i am very happy with this item .####['item']
bigger screen####['screen']
the battery capacity is 3 hours on a full charge####['battery capacity']
great amount of memory for a small business .####['memory']
excellent lapto , just as they show it .####['lapto']
good price , good quality and good service in korea .####['service']
the best laptop for its price .####['laptop']
lenovo computers are of chinese manufacture and thus you will not know if yours is one of the pla ' s cyber - spies .####['lenovo computers']
i ' ve had this laptop for 4 months and it ' s run very well considering it ' s price .####['laptop']
only issue is that the graphics aren ' t quite as good as i expected , but i didn ' t buy this to use as a gaming pc so i ' m not overly concerned about it .####['graphics']
this is a great laptop for web browsing , skype , and more simple games .####['laptop']
it ' s been about 3 weeks since my purchase of my lenova laptop and figure it ' s time to give my all important review .####['lenova laptop']
lenovo should put a better battery in it , and should make a retrofit available .####['better']
lenovo paid for my shipping to the repair facility since i ' d had it such a short time , and they fixed and returned it in a reasonable time period .####['lenovo']
laptop meets spec for what it was purchased to do but disappointed it was shipped with a charger not compatible with location it was shipped to ( needed to buy an adapter to convert from 2 pin to 3 pin plug )####['laptop']
keyboard is pretty damn good and the track pad is fair .####['track pad', 'keyboard']
has ac wireless so you can see the 5ghz on your network , blazing fast .####['ac wireless']
great laptop if you are willing to put in an ssd and reinstall windows .####['laptop']
it is very easy to use the set up was awesome .####['set up']
the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####['start up']
if your main priority is a long lasting battery this is n ' t for you .####['battery']
it is a very nice computer that serves his needs very well .####['computer']
i wish the camera was a little better , but it ' s great otherwise .####['camera']
i use this laptop for work .####['laptop']
it ' s not real fast and it doesn ' t have a lot of storage .####['storage']
the only problem that i have found about lenovo is that it comes with a program called migration , which is supposed to migrate your things from your old computer to your new computer .####['migration']
for reference : ive had this laptop for about 4 months now for my first year at college .####['laptop']
really happy with this laptop !####['laptop']
i have yet to update the drives on it or try a game but so far its a good machine .####['machine']
price and product , outstanding .####['product']
great laptop , very quick and efficient for work and casual gaming , got over 200 fps for steam games .####['laptop']
the solution i am trying for now is to disable the touch screen .####['touch screen']
if you are wanting a beautiful screen that beats all other tablets for color range and matches samsung ' s galaxy tab s3 ( top android tablet ) , but if you absolutely must have a keyboard , don ' t buy this .####['screen', 'keyboard']
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .####['screen']
to make things worse , i currently live overseas and am highly doubtful that samsung would do anything about this , given that it was bought in the us .####['samsung']
in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this product given the obvious history of quality control issues .####['product']
it ' s also worth noting my unit came with a floating trackpad , with initial play before the actually click .####['trackpad']
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####['device']
it is very limited and the competition for an actual usable operating system that can do a lot more than just browse the internet , are available .####['operating system']
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####['keyboard']
this is quite honest , a very expensive chrome browser .####['chrome browser']
after a couple of weeks i started experiencing web browsing issues .####['web browsing']
first occasionally and later to a point where the laptop became unusable .####['laptop']
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####['stylus']
i went in to this purchase assuming that the availability of android apps from the google play store would make this unit into a true windows alternative .####['android apps']
so one star off for the keyboard .####['keyboard']
i really needed this product for work and had big plans for using it ' s features / versatility .####['product']
apparently there is some optimizations that google has done with the op1 and pixel that allow what is called instant ink .####['google']
i have also noticed the pro seems to run hotter and have a noticeably shorter battery life .####['battery life', 'pro']
horrible , purchased directly from google , dead pixel on arrival , note feature did not pick up stylus and bluetooth rarely worked .####['pixel', 'bluetooth', 'stylus']
samsung makes garbage and treats their customers with no respect .####['samsung']
chrome os is not matured in any way .####['chrome os']
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####['chromeos']
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####['acer chromebook 14']
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .####['acer']
the hardware specs on this are very nice compared to other offerings : 4g ram , 32g storage , quad - core processor , etc .####['hardware specs']
the mouse area is responsive , and has a nice feel to it .####['mouse area']
the overall unit has a slim profile , and is light weight .####['unit']
beautiful ips display .####['ips display']
i ' m running it at 2500x1400 resolution extremely thin and lightweight .####['resolution']
the keyboard is good .####['keyboard']
but the 4 gb of ram makes the things you use a chromebook for work without delay .####['ram']
where they didn ' t sacrifice is on build quality .####['build quality']
i ' ve kept an eye on chromebooks for the last couple of years as a possible option for a low - cost laptop .####['laptop']
with a solid cpu and 4gb of memory i can run a dozen or more open tabs with good performance .####['memory', 'cpu']
this acer chromebook 14 is by far the best chromebook 300 dollars can buy .####['acer chromebook 14']
i could not be happier with this computer because i am not the best person with technology .####['computer']
first time users might have a hard time using the keyboard ( some keys like caps lock , pagedown , pageup , delete , home etc are missing , browse the internet to get the equivalent ones ) .####['keyboard']
the build quality is good ( all aluminum body ) .####['build quality']
the boot up is fast .####['boot up']
as for actual device it is completely gorgeous and ( now ) works flawlessly .####['device']
this acer is a web surfer that ' s easy to travel with .####['acer']
i purchased this item 7 months ago and i love it .####['item']
the only thing i did not like about the design is the fact that the speakers are on the bottom of the unit .####['speakers']
with real function keys , i don ' t worry about one vendor or another not upgrading fast enough and losing virtual function keys , so this model is golden .####['model']
- the computer is 1 pound ( approx .####['computer']
battery life : i haven ' t had the laptop for too long but easily get 8 hours or more on a charge .####['battery life']
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .####['trackpad']
sure , another generation back was arguably better , but i find this computer to be adequate to my needs right now ( though it is a disappointment that i can ' t upgrade the ram , which definitely limits the lifetime of how long this product will last ) .####['computer']
the overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold .####['design']
the force touch trackpad works great .####['force touch trackpad']
and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .####['system']
fantastic computer !####['computer']
the mbp does not run as hot as my old white mb did .####['mbp']
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####['apps', 'chrome', 'google docs / drive']
but the mac looked and worked great .####['mac']
it boots up instantaneously .####['boots up']
it is a small , light , powerful device that until 2016 seemed custom fit for content creators , photographers , and other such lines of work or hobbies .####['device']
the new retina is amazing and the speed is awesome .####['speed', 'retina']
well macbook is no less than expected .####['macbook']
i love this laptop .####['laptop']
wonderful machine fast , clean , solid i have to said that this guy i fell from my hands the first day i use , goes to the floor and nothing happens screen is perfect and nothing is damage !####['screen', 'machine']
condition even better then i expect .####['condition']
now i keep seeing headlines for bad battery life and other woes for the 2016 edition and feel extra satisfied by my choice .####['battery life']
it ' s a great computer .####['computer']
i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !####['mac']
1 - itunes match ( $ 25 / yr i believe ) keeps all of your music synced across all of your ios devices with no limit .####['itunes match']
i ' ve only had it for one day and the set up was easy , and all items delivered were present , will update over time !####['set up']
the display clarity is outstanding .####['display clarity']
love my macbook , beautiful and use daily !####['macbook']
this is a lovely product that i recommend for general use as a student , less so for gaming and storing whatnot .####['product']
fast delivery , brand new as expected .####['delivery']
i was super worried that touching the keyboard when it was in tablet mode would cause it to switch back to laptop mode , but it looks like once you move the screen back past like 180 degrees , it goes into full touchscreen .####['keyboard']
i also bought a wireless mouse , which paired perfectly .####['wireless mouse']
well , i have to say , i ' m fairly impressed with my new chrome flipbook !####['chrome flipbook']
my only complaint is the click on the touchpad feels a little cheap , but i just use ` ` tap to click ` ` so it ' s not an issue .####['touchpad']
i chose this one mainly because of the full size keyboard , larger screen , and full size hdmi .####['screen', 'hdmi', 'keyboard']
yes , this chromebook comes with the android app store pre - installed .####['chromebook']
although 4 gigs of ram doesn ' t seem like a lot to some of us , because of the simple software , it is very fast with no lag .####['software', 'ram']
the power button is no longer on the keyboard , but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine .####['power button']
this machine , through her minimum time of using it , has already been so much faster for her to use .####['machine']
this by far has been the easiest to set up and use .####['set up']
this model has a defect .####['model']
the laptop is in great physical conditions , no scratches or anything , but certain actions run slowly , specifically any file read or write , like copying a document , uploading an image , creating a new file , etc .####['laptop']
as soon as i turned on the computer , it froze as i tried to sync information .####['computer']
unfortunately this macbook is part of the ` ` staingate ` ` series , i would not suggest to buy this as apple doesn ' t seem to care about customers buying a faulty product that is very expensive####['apple', 'product']
have not heard any complaints about the product .####['product']
it turns out that it ' s not a stain , but the anti - reflective coating coming off .####['anti - reflective coating']
great aesthetics .####['aesthetics']
transferring files from a non - iphone phone , like android is extremely annoying .####['android']
the quality is terrible ( both versions ) for such a pricey product .####['product']
* decent selection of ports for its size####['ports']
paradoxically , this laptop is a ` ` pro ` ` .####['laptop']
this is a great computer .####['computer']
beware that stains in the coating of the display have been detected in all of the macbook retina editions .####['display']
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####['device']
my second asus chromebook has died .####['asus chromebook']
most apps run pretty - ok in beta - some problems i ' m noticing in beta are that bluetooth is less than ideal and i believe battery life suffers greatly , now that i ' ve been paying attention to it .####['apps', 'bluetooth', 'battery life']
i ' m still loving the * idea * of what the c302 is supposed to be , but the execution is feeling more and more of a miss .####['c302']
i will update this review when there is further progress - i believe this is a 5 star product but the updates are reducing my confidence in the software .####['software', 'product']
great machine out of the box .####['machine']
the c302 is a great machine .####['c302']
i ' ve had mine 10 months and the motherboard has crapped out twice already .####['motherboard']
my disappointment begins with the fact that chromeos is not touch - ready and most websites will not consider touch interface for desktop mode websites .####['chromeos']
at first i was totally stoked on this chromebook .####['chromebook']
vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####['vlc media player']
the machine is easy to use , snappy , and everything the reviewers say .####['machine']
so be forwarded , if you buy this , you are jumping right into a machine that won ' t get updates anymore ( which is something most chromebook owners want and a feature that makes them better than android and it ' s fragmented market ) .####['machine']
many apps won ' t download and work on it like they do on an ellipsis .####['apps']
this is not an inexpensive product , especially for a chrome book but , i figured you get what you pay for .####['product']
the one star is for warranty support .####['warranty support']
- i love the chromebook overall####['chromebook']
works great as a chromebook but chromebooks are still very limited for android compatibility , at least this one is .####['chromebooks', 'chromebook']
however , for using it as a tablet / computer with streaming , it seems to only work half the time .####['tablet / computer with streaming']
netflix and hulu seem to be working for the most part so far , but amazon prime and xfinity stream are both having issues .####['xfinity stream', 'netflix', 'hulu seem', 'amazon prime']
the computer is great , but the charger is garbage .####['charger', 'computer']
they just don ' t get loud enough and that ' s crucial for me since i watch a lot of youtube and listen to music while doing other things on the machine .####['machine']
the sound and screen quality is low .####['sound', 'screen quality']
the computer is nice , blah blah it has nice features but it stops working after a few months .####['computer']
app game ( simpsons tapped out ) ( i know don ' t judge ) lags at every moment .####['app game']
the chromebook seems to be working fine now and my daughter does love it .####['chromebook']
however , the speakers are already starting to crackle , and i haven ' t even had the thing for a week .####['speakers']
moreover i ' m quite upset because it seems amazon will not pay me back the shipping fees , which for me amount to about 100 $ as i live in france .####['amazon']
it also has a great backlit keyboard .####['backlit keyboard']
i love how i can charge my laptop on both sides of the device .####['laptop', 'device']
i much suspect that google ' s half baked sustem is at fault .####["google ' s half baked sustem"]
10 months in my battery will no longer charge .####['battery']
this product is built well , but it won ' t run the one android app i hoped it would run , and for whatever reason the app and os update download speeds are abysmal .####['app and os update download speeds', 'product']
upon further inspection , i had noticed that one of the side speakers was pushed in and the plastic surrounding it had a crack .####['side speakers']
only three months in , and the laptop won ' t charge .####['laptop']
something wrong with the battery .####['battery']
i loved this chromebook but i had to return it bevause it had sound issues .####['sound', 'chromebook']
chromebooks are a waste of time / money .####['chromebooks']
so disappointing to receive the laptop and it wouldn ' t even power up .####['laptop']
video playback is poor with the amazon prime video player .####['amazon prime video player']
i just fear for the long term ruggedness of the exterior .####['exterior']
the screen is good , the tablet mode is nice , and the keyboard has a good feel .####['screen', 'keyboard', 'tablet mode']
first one i received , the space bar got stuck and returned it for a replacement .####['space bar']
screen is good .####['screen']
it is not up to my expectations , it produces some kind of sound when you play something on youtube ( from its keyboard ) perhaps !####['sound']
this is the worst computer i have ever owned .####['computer']
the touchpad is above average , but not great .####['touchpad']
this is my third and last chromebook .####['chromebook']
very fast product , but with this kind of technology it ' s not possible to use a program , that i work ( minitab ) .####['product']
i updated the realtek audio drivers and tested it using razer surround ' s audio drivers ; it still did not fix it .####['realtek audio drivers']
i had previouslu bought an msi mobo which refused to boot unless windows 10 was the os , but i had worked around all of those problems .####['msi mobo']
it is apparent the hard drive has failed yet again .####['hard drive']
i ' ve never owned an msi laptop and if i can help it , this one is going back and i will never own one again .####['msi laptop']
msi used to have a driver installer by disk that would install all the proper drivers in the right order , so you ' d have the perfect configuration .####['driver installer']
im actually wondering if there is an issue with the speakers , it ' s so bad .####['speakers']
the unit is whisper quiet and hasn ' t gotten hot no matter how hard i push it .####['unit']
the ssd is not work after 4 month####['ssd']
the responses in the faq are wrong , this does not have 16 gb of ram , almost gave it a 1 star bexause of this reason .####['responses']
keyboard layout is not the best , do not like that i have to press the function key to raise or lower the volume / brightness on the arrow keys .####['keyboard layout is']
in essence , if you want a gaming pc , this one will do the job .####['pc']
this laptop is actually horrible .####['laptop']
do not buy this computer !####['computer']
multiple system crashes .####['system']
so called msi tech support , went through the troubleshooting and of course they could not fix it .####['msi tech support']
only been using it for about a week , continuously getting the error that it can not connect to speakers .####['speakers']
this laptop is my first time using the intel optane thing and after this i can not recommend it .####['laptop']
i absolutely love this laptop , it looks great , its quality is amazing and can handle so many games without any lag involved .####['laptop']
system shutdown problems every month .####['system']
tech support is useless .####['tech support']
update : i have had this computer for about 3 months now , and it is full of problems .####['computer']
i got this laptop 2 days ago and it says plugged in , not charged .####['laptop']
microphone is really low .####['microphone']
computer was good but i would not recommend for battery .####['battery', 'computer']
to bad the battery did n ' t work out .####['battery']
* * * update * * * this laptop has already bit the dust ; it crashed with a blue screen of death , and then refused to power back on .####['laptop']
update review : having had this laptop for a few months it has had a bad crash from a recent windows update .####['laptop']
for $ 499 the laptop is a bargain , but you should only buy if you you plan to add an ssd in the near future .####['laptop']
no backlit keyboard####['backlit keyboard']
not only is it a hdd , but its a slow one .####['hdd']
the ram is expandable ; i bought 8 gb additional and installed myself fairly easily .####['ram']
it is fast and lightweight .####['it']
it ' s a good system and has loads of space available for storage :####['storage', 'system']
all in all a great cheap gaming laptop that even with the cons i am not dissatisfied with the product .####['gaming laptop']
i like this laptop , for a 15 ` ` monitor laptop with i5 - 8250u cpu , the weight is acceptable for me to carry it to work between different office .####['weight']
awesome computer .####['computer']
well , wifi worked instantly without bugs .####['wifi']
on the flip side , this asus is very fast with minimal bloatware that is easy to get rid of .####['asus']
this is a decent laptop no thanks to asus support .####['laptop']
i bought the computer on january 2018 and so far i am really enjoying it .####['computer']
the keyboard is okay .####['keyboard']
unfortunately this chromebook is very sluggish .####['chromebook']
support got quite unpleasant when i ask about replacement .####['support']
very good build quality , except for the keyboard apparently , sound was very big , very fast boot times and so much more .####['boot times', 'build quality', 'keyboard', 'sound']
the screen display isn ' t bright at all !####['screen display']
if you use wix to edit websites the scroll bar will not appear once you enter editor page , thus making it impossible to design / build / update websites .####['wix']
i was disappointed with the touch pad would stick and when it broke loose it over shot the target .####['touch pad']
do not buy this machine if you ' re hoping to run android apps .####['machine']
my computer was used on average a couple hours a day .####['computer']
first one had a white line on the screen , then went and got a replacement , not even six months into this one and the graphics card failed .####['screen', 'graphics']
laptop failed after only six months of use .####['laptop']
it would not start up after 2 months of purchase and then re - set button didn ' t work .####['re - set button']
its a good computer for the price but it needs to work awhile without crashing within 6 months .####['computer']
at this point i no longer trusted this model and was afraid of having the same issue with a replacement if i exchanged it , and then not having enough time to do another exchange and still be able to charge and configure it in time to wrap and put under the christmas tree for my son , so i contacted amazon and they gladly e - mailed me a return shipping label and refunded my money in full in 3 days , after receiving it back from me .####['amazon', 'model']
i hate to knock acer as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new product and then not being able to turn it on to use it .####['acer', 'product']
twice in 10 days i had an issue , pointer , where they said turn it over and put a pin in it .####['pointer']
it ' s far too early in this machine ' s life to be encountering problems , the company has very poor customer service , and i would strongly recommend against purchasing .####['company']
battery is not as long####['battery']
could have been a great computer if not for the terrible keyboard construction .####['keyboard construction', 'computer']
about 4 hours of battery####['battery']
the fingerprint sensor is a nice touch and the color and feel of the laptop material is also nice .####['fingerprint sensor', 'laptop material']
15 ` ` screen , full sized keyboard and speed fast enough for some low quality games such as lol .####['speed fast', 'keyboard']
this is a painfully slow computer .####['computer']
- screen looks good####['screen looks']
after running through the setup wizard , the laptop failed to boot .####['laptop']
though it is competitively priced for the specs , the laptop felt cheap .####['laptop', 'specs']
- excellent cpu####['cpu']
- the hard drive is really slow and really loud .####['hard drive']
it ' s a good enough laptop .####['laptop']
2 stars taken for horrible sound quality####['sound quality']
this computer completely shut down after 2 months .####['computer']
the only issue i ' m having is battery life .####['battery life']
the battery broke after just 4 months from baying it am so disappointed with the product####['battery', 'product']
it has a glassy - smooth surface that resists finger - prints and goop , is very large , and has a firm but not too - clunky feeling click to it .####['surface']
finally , there are the ports .####['ports']
- port minimalism .####['port']
- clean and secure operating system that is very lean and gets the most out of the systems modest specs####['operating system', 'specs']
- android apps and google play store are real game changers for the chromeos landscape .####['google play store']
- system settings could be more robust and better organized####['system settings']
d ) a bluetooth mouse - while this unarguably has one of the best trackpads in chromebook land , there are still times you just need the precision of a mouse .####['trackpads']
it ' s much smoother with web pages and android apps , and the touch screen is more responsive .####['android apps', 'web pages', 'touch screen']
then the asus flip c302 came into my life :####['asus flip c302']
80 % of the apps it ' s a poor experience .####['apps']
the asus c302 is the best chromebook you can buy .####['asus c302', 'chromebook']
the touch screen is super responsive and the keyboard is excellent .####['touch screen', 'keyboard']
and because of the constant usage of higher brightness , the battery does drain faster .####['battery']
one , the display is gorgeous ; watching video is a treat .####['display']
my use experience has been riddled with lag and jitteriness , although using the touchscreen for a moment sorts everything out .####['touchscreen']
the speakers get plenty loud , but they start to sound pretty bad when turned up a little past half volume .####['speakers']
the core m3 allows this system to get fast and to stay quiet .####['core m3']
boot up is of course , almost instant .####['boot up']
- excellent keyboard in all aspects - feel , rigidity , and backlight####['keyboard']

- the build quality is great but not necessarily impressive .####['build quality']
i wish the display was able to go about 1 or 2 clicks brighter and about 1 click darker at the lowest setting .####['display']

the color of everything is so very much brighter and clearer it makes the extra cost is worth more for just that .####['color']
bought this because of the touch screen and specs capable of running android ( and it ' s a supported model ) .####['specs']

i ' ve been happy with all of the asus devices i ' ve purchased ( several computers and tablets ) but this is a real gem .####['asus devices']
the good news is that the android features ( google play store apps ) work nearly across the board .####['android features']
it served my needs of web browsing and word processing for a number of years , but its battery life had dwindled and neither the screen nor the processor can match this asus .####['screen', 'battery life', 'processor']
lightweight , gorgeous , great screen / picture quaity , sound could be louder but still good , fast processor ( i do a lot of research , photo processing , netflix watching and reading on the laptop ) .####['processor', 'sound']
the touchscreen is great though and feels very intuitive .####['touchscreen']
- battery life is a bit short after some gaming####['battery life']
- touch pad seems a little off to me .####['touch pad']
outside of that , the keyboard is solid , the back lighting was not a selling point to me .####['back lighting', 'keyboard']

a great chromebook .####['chromebook']

the negatives , the battery will need charging what feels like every 6ish hours depending on use and the speakers are insufficient .####['battery', 'speakers']
