this unit is ` ` pretty ` ` and stylish , so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason .####['unit']
some apps don ' t work but the play store is still in beta right now####['play store', 'apps']
the screen is very dim however .####['screen']
keyboard is decent with good travel .####['keyboard']
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####['machines', 'asus']
buy this computer and you ' ll be very happy with it .####['computer']
this is the best laptop for the price .####['laptop']
i like that it ' s got the 8th generation i5 cpu .####['8th generation i5 cpu']
it boots in seconds although i usually just leave it on constantly .####['boots']
great computer and great value , our second chromebook and first one still doing fine just needed another for family .####['computer']
very easy to set up .####['set up']
i ' m using it mainly to store movies , and the 1 tb drive is nice .####['drive']
so , i have had this laptop for almost a week and have put it through the ringer .####['laptop']
if you ' re big on aesthetics then you ' ll love the look .####['look']
it has a full size keyboard , a number pad , a camera , and great big screen !####['keyboard', 'screen', 'camera', 'number pad']
many apps aren ' t ` ` compatible ` ` and even the ones that work , they look awful .####['apps']
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####['device']
for home users , these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two - screening , to watching videos and calling family .####['machines']
as a 5 - year chromebook veteran , i ' ve been waiting for this machine .####['machine']
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####['processor']
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####['chromebook']
honestly , i think nobody uses these ports anyway .####['ports']
maybe that ' s a consequence of how the retina display is built , but yeah , it ' s harder to keep the screen clean .####['screen']
i am extremely happy with this laptop .####['laptop']
battery life is a huge plus !####['battery life']
price was very good and met my expectations also shipping was very quick .####['shipping']
configuring the printer was a little tricky but not bad .####['printer']
my desktop runs all my video editing software for my bigger and most demanding projects and mylaptop is great for editing video and running pc games in places other than my home ( like school ! )####['mylaptop']
i have not had any freezing or screen flashing issues .####['screen']
* extremely weak graphics card .####['graphics card']
all metal body , very slim form factor , and has a pretty decent touchscreen .####['factor', 'touchscreen']
the first issue is that the speakers are on either side of the computer , and you can barely hear them on max volume .####['speakers']
don ' t get me wrong , the device flips back and forth very well .####['device']
it ' s their policy to only repair not replace .####['policy']
other than this , it ' s a decent product .####['product']
i would * not * recommend this laptop .####['laptop']
now , i have been stressed with fixing this laptop since every day has been something new that i need to fix with it .####['laptop']
the overall material the laptop is made of feels incredibly cheap .####['overall material the laptop']
this is the worst laptop i have ever bought in my entire life .####['laptop']
moreover , the 8th gen i5 cpu is amazing .####['8th gen i5 cpu']
love the form factor and the light weight as i often use my laptop while laying down .####['my laptop']
before the review this package has nice presentation and solid build .####['build', 'package']
( good ) as for the laptop ( when it worked , and i mean for the whole 30 minutes ) it was extremely fast .####['laptop']
having ram problems after 1 .####['ram']
one of the keys is especially flimsy and feels like it could break at any moment .####['one of the keys']
a big part of this device is its gorgeous aesthetic .####['device']
this is a great device and the $ 450 asking price seems fair .####['device']
love this chromebook !####['chromebook']
setup was fast and easy , but then again i ' ve been a gmail / gcal / gdocs purist for a while now .####['setup']
it ' s lighter , good construction , chromebook works perfectly and downloaded 10 different apps i normally use for free .####['construction', 'chromebook']
i love the keyboard , trackpad and screen .####['keyboard', 'screen', 'trackpad']
the speakers are super clear and get loud enough , but obviously lack bass .####['speakers']
the build quality seems very good .####['build quality']
i ' m four months into owning this lean , mean , little machine .####['machine']
cons : no usb ports .####['usb ports']
