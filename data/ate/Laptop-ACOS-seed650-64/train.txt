chrome os is not matured in any way .####['chrome os']
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .####['acer']
where they didn ' t sacrifice is on build quality .####['build quality']
i ' ve kept an eye on chromebooks for the last couple of years as a possible option for a low - cost laptop .####['laptop']
this acer chromebook 14 is by far the best chromebook 300 dollars can buy .####['acer chromebook 14']

and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .####['system']

i love this laptop .####['laptop']

transferring files from a non - iphone phone , like android is extremely annoying .####['android']

this laptop is my first time using the intel optane thing and after this i can not recommend it .####['laptop']
