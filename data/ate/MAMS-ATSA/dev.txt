after a couple of drinks, the apps--i like the lobster/mango summer roll and the cripsy squid--go down great.####['drinks', 'roll', 'cripsy squid']
the basil pepper mojito was a little daunting in concept, but i was refreshed at the flavor.####['flavor', 'basil pepper mojito']
had to constantly ask the waiter to top up water glasses, but generally service was ok.####['water glasses', 'waiter', 'service']
the portions were so small that we still wanted to eat after dinner.####['portions', 'dinner']
the staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.####['drinks', 'bar', 'staff', 'menu']
on the other hand, the soup was so clear and you taste no salt.####['soup', 'salt']
we went out on the town with the idea that we were going to mingle with the in crowd, you know, go to a place where you pay an outrageous cover charge, have to wear all black to fit in, and pay $12 for a watered-down martini, and if you're lucky, have a good time.####['time', 'watered-down martini']
the waiter had a slight attitude and brought our wine aprroximately 10 minutes into our appetizer.####['waiter', 'wine', 'appetizer', 'attitude']
appetizers and entrees were merely adequate, but you can't beat the pool room for atmosphere.####['appetizers', 'atmosphere']
however for the price i paid to have dinner there, you would have thought i ate a horse.####['price', 'dinner']
i called to confirm the reservations on the morning of the lunch and the hostess had the reservations set for 12:30pm which i quickly corrected.####['lunch', 'hostess']
the small bar is always packed with people, and you have to constantly contend with waiters asking you to move as they navigate through the crowd to make it to their tables.####['bar', 'waiters']
regardless of the amount of customers, the wait for food is insanely long.####['food', 'wait']
the decor isn't quite like shun lee but the service will definitely make up for any shortcoming.####['service', 'decor']
and there wasn't much room for the people at the bar to stand either, as the restaurant attempted to squeeze as many tables into the restaurant as they could, forcing those dining to have to shift in their chairs every time a waiter attempted to get by.####['dining', 'chairs', 'tables', 'bar', 'waiter']
in short it's a bakery, takeout place and cafe all in one, and thanks to dishes prepared using the same ingredients stocked at famed gourmet food emporium, zabar's, prices and quality are upscale.####['dishes', 'place', 'prices', 'ingredients', 'quality']
but it's the ambience that is the draw for me---sipping red wine and sitting under the red awning on a warm night.####['ambience', 'red wine']
the service was fine, out appitizers took forever to come out, and then they dumped the rest of the food on us, without giving us a chance to enjoy our appitizers.####['service', 'food']
the servers, casual in their striped button-downs, anticipate and fulfill needs as if they were trained as mind readers.####['striped button-downs', 'servers']
the food did come out quickly and was good, but not worth the prices or the wait.####['food', 'wait']
the fries were absolutly inedible, and the coldslaw tasted like it was straight out of a bucket from sam's, and the friend shrimp had too much curry.####['curry', 'fries', 'shrimp']
my one complaint is that when we were finished with our dinner, it took an abnormally long time for our waitress to get with the program and bring us our check.####['waitress', 'dinner']
but wait, it gets even better, the mussels were so fishy that i had the server try one since he had a hard time believing that this was true.####['server', 'mussels', 'wait']
this place happens to be beatifully designed, the atmosphere is relaxed (as opposed to the noisy community dining atmosphere in so many busy chinese reataurants - which can also be ok) the food is authentic chinese as opposed to what they think americans would like, the staff is friendly and unhurried.####['food', 'staff', 'community dining atmosphere']
please have the spinach dip, caesar salad, hawaiian rib-eye and the brownie for dessert.####['caesar salad', 'spinach dip', 'dessert']
the atmosphere is warmly dim and inviting - if you make a reservation, ask for a corner both for extra coziness!####['reservation', 'corner', 'atmosphere']
but we waiting two hours to get it (we had reservations but it was late so we wanted to try to come in earlier).####['reservations', 'waiting']
the waitress at the bar was very nasty to me because she mistakenly took an order for thai ice tea from me when i asked for thai lemonade in a to-go cup.####['waitress', 'bar', 'thai lemonade']
in short the bi-level dining room, which resembles a bamboo-thatched hut, is a brightly-lit, wide-open space with high ceilings and laminated depictions of indian village life.####['bi-level dining room', 'space']
superfine is my preferred destination in the city when i'm looking for a casual, hip atmosphere, extraordinary food at decent prices and/or just a place to get a good drink, chat with the bartender and shoot some (free) pool.####['food', 'prices', 'bartender', 'atmosphere']
an otherwise fine meal was trashed when i realized that the dish i had ordered contained chicked, despite my asking for no chicken, no pork twice.####['meal', 'dish']
the food the key element to a proper british chip is fat, and the flabby, pale yellow specimens here come close to the ideal.####['food', 'specimens']
the dinner menu looks like it has a more interesting selection of entrees, but if they are even the fraction of the quality of the items we ate for lunch, i whole-heartedly advise you to make it a point and dine at creama--if not for the drinks, then definitely for the unique approach to mexican.####['entrees', 'lunch', 'mexican', 'quality']
we made a reservation for 5:30pm (20 people) and people were still arriving at 5:45 (over half the group was there) when the manager came over and literally yelled at us for not being on time saying it was a busy time for him, when in fact there were several empty tables throughout the restaurant.####['tables', 'reservation', 'manager']
when i went for sunday brunch, not only was the food bland and cold, they didn't even bother to clear the plates once they brought the bill.####['food', 'brunch', 'plates', 'bill']
the wasa waffle was different but when we spoke to the manager he inmediatly changed if for another dish (he suggested the chocolate decadence french toast.####['dish', 'wasa', 'manager']
the pizza is thet always fresh and just made they hav an outdoor seating area that is partially covered they also have a full service restaurant on the premises they make everything on premises.####['pizza', 'service', 'outdoor seating area']
consistently satisfying versions of thai staples like pad thai and curry dishes arrive in generous portions.####['portions', 'thai staples', 'pad thai and curry dishes']
i naively thought dinner was served during the show, but the waiters don't come by once the shows start, so order your wine 30 mins before the show start time.####['wine', 'served', 'dinner', 'waiters']
the menu is limited so i opted for the jalapeno potato soup and a romaine salad.####['menu', 'romaine salad']
other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.####['pizza', 'fish and chips', 'santa fe chopped salad']
the items available during dimsum time were plentiful - the turnip cake was excellent.####['dimsum', 'turnip cake']
i would recommend going at off-times (before 7 perhaps) to avoid the crowds as it gets packed and there isn't much room by the bar.####['bar', 'crowds']
i mean no disrespect to the owner, just constructive criticism - improve the decor and dine-in service, but don't change the portions or the recipes.####['portions', 'recipes', 'decor']
at no point during our dinner were we left alone to simply enjoy our food.####['food', 'dinner']
waitress didn't know anything about the menu, but other than that i would recommend.####['waitress', 'menu']
with tacky kitsch as the decor's dominant motif and the obligatory grousing waiters hustling out brick-sized steaks and icy vodka to gussied-up regulars and tourists, an evening at sammy's is both dinner and street theater.####['obligatory', 'dinner', 'waiters', 'decor', 'vodka']
handsome baritone nordic waiters patrol the room, proffering fresh-squeezed juices and $4-a-person pots of french press coffee.####['press coffee', 'waiters']
although it was quite good, the small portions at this table of 4, including appetizers, did not constitute adequate sustenance.####['appetizers', 'portions']
the green hair table and seating at the front window was tacky and gimmicky, but figured it's the food that counts.####['food', 'green hair table', 'seating', 'front window']
the food was average: the almond crusted halibut was bland, while the sashimi appetizer was excellent.####['almond crusted halibut', 'sashimi appetizer']
first, the hostess gave us a nasty look when asked if we could eat at the bar, and then just swished her hand to indicate we could seat ourselves.####['bar', 'hostess']
despite him not being my designated server, he basically took over for our inexperienced waiter the rest of the dinner.####['waiter', 'server', 'dinner']
after requesting to be seated at an empty table, the waitress (who was so terribly burdened when we asked to move from the bar to the table to have dinner) asked us to get up from our seats and wait for a smaller table because a party of 3 just walked in.####['waitress', 'bar', 'dinner']
sat at the bar and orderd a few appetizers, the humus and cheese plates along with some calamari - all very tasty.####['bar', 'humus and cheese plates', 'calamari']
the hostess is rude as can be, the waiters can't stop to check in, the busboys are flinging stuff on your table, and that's true even when the restaurant is half empty!####['table', 'busboys']
call it a bar with weak but tasty sangria and leave it at that.####['bar', 'sangria']
for $65, you will get a 5-6 course tasting menu encompassing a variety of raw fish, cooked fish, pastas, dessert, etc.####['pastas', 'raw fish', 'menu', 'dessert']
never on the menu or in my inquiry to the waitress was the word garlic mentioned.####['waitress', 'menu']
i was at opia january 5, 2006 we had some drinks, dinner, i have to say that we had me and my friend great time, the staff was listening, the manager knew what he was doing and the food better than ever!!####['drinks', 'manager', 'staff', 'dinner']
it wasn't until we spoke with management that we were able to finish our meal and get out of the restaurant, but already one of our party had to leave early and the rest of us were late for our afternoon engagements.####['meal', 'engagements', 'management']
it is a must for lunch,dinner or anytime you have a big appetite and don't want to spend big bucks in the big apple!####['apple', 'lunch', 'dinner']
what it lacks in decor it more than makes up in the cuisine.####['cuisine', 'decor']
went for lunch the bartenders were great, also they had a dj playing music during the day, there was a huge screen tv playing music videos and a bunch of other tvs with all the sports you could look at.####['dj', 'lunch', 'bartenders']
the waitress encouraged to come for dinner and brunch, and i followed her recommandation.####['waitress', 'brunch', 'dinner']
our waiter was very prompt and friendly, but the worst part of the experience was actually after the meal when i was leaving.####['meal', 'waiter']
me and my wife we go there at least once a month, the food they give you is amazing we only get one order of pasta and main course it is enough for both to share,we get full and satisfied, our favorite dish penne with pesto.####['pesto', 'main course', 'pasta', 'dish', 'food']
the service has always been outstanding and even when we didn't have a reservation they worked something out, where i agreed to keep our meal to just eating.####['service', 'reservation', 'meal']
the hostess wasn't sure until 3 hours later 10:28: here we go eggplant parmigiana fried grease an heavy duty pollo dish covered with 1/4 of a pound of mozzarella.####['mozzarella', 'dish']
once we ordered, it took at least 30 minutes to get our food, with our server no where in site.####['food', 'server']
thanks to waiter i learned so much about wine too.####['waiter', 'wine']
down right comfortable, pleasant, enormous portions, have lunch and bring home a doggie bag wth your dinner.####['lunch', 'portions', 'dinner']
a couple of hints: 1) avoid going during peak lunch and dinner hours - everything is made fresh so it takes time, 2) definitely try their concrete desert - my favorite is chocolate with bananas and hot fudge mixed in.####['chocolate', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'bananas']
we felt the waiter and captain rushed us through our meal.####['meal', 'waiter', 'captain']
the desserts are just as good as all the coffee shops around town but they charge more than anyone.####['coffee', 'desserts']
you might be lucky enough to hear your waiter say, may i take zee order from you, pig dog, while you're there.####['waiter', 'pig dog']
recommended to those who want to try a different setting for a diner.####['diner', 'setting']
definitely one of the slope's best bets for chinese food -- or for vegetarians (there's an extensive veggy menu, as well as many meat dishes).####['meat dishes', 'chinese food', 'menu']
in the main dining room, finding your waiter is hell and aside from when they take your order and bring the bill, you'll rarely see them.####['waiter', 'main dining room']
we had a five-course dinner and none of the dishes really impressed except maybe the signature oysters and pearls.####['dishes', 'five-course dinner', 'signature oysters']
the food is pretty good, but the staff would rather be anywhere than waiting tables at maison.####['waiting tables', 'food', 'staff']
i went there for lunch on a quiet weekday afternoon and everything my friend and i ordered was immaculately presented and absolutely delicious-- i had moules frites and she had the salmon burger.####['weekday', 'salmon burger', 'lunch', 'moules frites']
the food is not nearly good enough to wait an hour before seeing your server, or wait another hour for the wrong entrees, or for the manager to make up for it by charging for everthing but giving us on the house shot glasses of watery margaritas.####['food', 'server', 'manager', 'entrees']
and although i've noticed that the prices have gone up a little since they opened, it's still a great menu.####['prices', 'menu']
for dinner i recommend carne tampiquea (steak) and for brunch the huaraches with meat and a couple eggs on top, a typical mexican hangover plate!####['brunch', 'eggs', 'dinner']
even with reservation, it might take up to one hour to get a table and the staff might not even say a word about it.####['reservation', 'staff']
the food is above average, though the portions a tad small, even for tapas; but they more than make up for it with their wonderfull mojitos.####['portions', 'mojitos']
as for the people whom posted about the salad, i never had it, as for the person that had no sides with the steak, they must have made a mistake, everytime i go its come's with awesome potatoes.####['salad', 'potatoes', 'steak']
the service was adequate though we did need to keep asking for water and the drinks from the bar took a long time- plus the restaraurant was not crowded.####['service', 'drinks', 'bar']
the arrogant maitre'd was annoyed when i asked about sitting down those tables are for other reservations low and behold those tables were still open as my wife and i finished dinner.####['reservations', 'maitre', 'dinner']
i have been here a few times and never had a boring meal!food always fresh, service very civilized.####['meal', 'food', 'service']
over a period of time some restaurants tend to loose the quality of the taste of their food, but not ray's.####['taste', 'food', 'quality']
the manager very politely told the drunk man that he could leave and then gave everyone on the resturaunt a free glass of port for having to witness it.####['glass', 'manager']
save the $$ and go to to curry hill (just 2-3 blocks away) or spend the $$ at a midtown indian eatery  (also: i commented to hostess prior to seating that there were a lot of tables empty when choosing my seat, and she snapped back that they had a lot of reservations coming in at one time.####['reservations', 'tables', 'seating', 'hostess']
an unfriendly hostess greeted us and placed us in the main room of the restaurant where the tables were so close together that it was impossible for guests and waiter to move without bumping you.####['waiter', 'tables', 'hostess']
all in all the food was above average and i would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners.####['dinners', 'food']
it took forever to seat us even though the restaurant was almost completely empty, then we had to ask to be waited on, it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks, and then another 30 minutes to get our salad and then even more time to get our pizza and then our bill.####['drinks', 'seat']
the scene at this sleek spot on a relatively sparse stretch of spring street, regulars belly up to a small bar and greet owner giorgio deluca, of dean and deluca fame, with warm hugs.####['hugs', 'bar', 'owner', 'scene']
the food seems so-so, although the nachos were really yummy (fake hot cheese w/ big cups of beans, chili guac on the side).####['food', 'chili guac', 'beans']
both appetizer and main were poorly made by some random cooks the picked up from who knows where.####['cooks', 'main']
but a server coming up to the table chewing gum while she went through the specials is not my idea of professional.####['server', 'specials']
called to complain and the response was well, we didn't charge you for the falafel sandwich we shorted you.####['falafel sandwich', 'response']
we had to wait by the door, and the host failed to acknowledge our existence for a whole 15 minutes!####['door', 'host']
they kept us waiting for more than an hour with a reservation and without an apology.####['reservation', 'waiting']
the food is incredibly tasting and, if you want an advice: grill calamari, rigatoni a la vodka and, for dessert, tartufata.####['food', 'grill calamari', 'rigatoni', 'dessert']
the 'people watching' and table location (on boardwalk) made up for the rude service.####['table location', 'service']
i liked the hummos platter, the brie sandwich, and about 20 other things on the menu (if they still have the chocolate cake you need to get it).####['brie sandwich', 'chocolate cake', 'menu', 'hummos platter']
only drawback is the sound level - quite a loud space downstairs - and that might be accounted for with their trendy bar and right off times square.####['bar', 'space downstairs']
we are a huge fan of their brunch - specifically the blt with a fried egg and avocado and their asparagus omelette with truffle oil.####['asparagus omelette with truffle oil', 'fried egg and avocado', 'brunch']
for dinner we decided to share on the veal cordon blue (wow) and the artic char, a nice dish.####['dish', 'dinner', 'veal cordon blue']
sashimi was ok (maki rolls tasted better).####['rolls', 'sashimi']
worth the trip over the bridge, worth the search for parking, worth the wait for a table at dinner time and worthy of a ten rating.####['table', 'dinner']
we were told by the hostess to make sure we were on time for our reservation, which we were, but then they kept us waiting for 15 minutes when we got there.####['reservation', 'waiting', 'hostess']
while the deocr in the dining room is less than inviting, i recommend eating at the bar where there is full menu service.####['dining room', 'bar']
relaxed neighborhooders treat the spot like a second home, calling the staff by name and lingering despite the smallish bar and hurried courses.####['spot', 'bar', 'staff']
the scene schnack feels a lot like a roller-rink concession stand circa 1982, from the deep vinyl booths and beat-up chairs right down to the loud music and plastic menu boards.####['menu boards', 'scene']
the restaurant is attractively decorated but totally lacks an atmosphere partly because of the extra bright lighting.####['lighting', 'atmosphere']
same quality for 1/3 the price and a realistic atmosphere.####['price', 'atmosphere']
also available is eggplant in garlic sauce, the zen vegi-burger, with sunflower seeds, kale and brown rice, and curry-rice-noodle soup.####['soup', 'eggplant in garlic sauce', 'zen vegi-burger']
then, the waitress gave my wife coffee with regular milk in it even though my wife specifically requested soy milk.####['waitress', 'soy milk']
i will definitely try dinner, but they do need to fix the kitchen shifts so that people get served in a reasonable time.####['kitchen', 'dinner']
one of the managers offered us a seat at the bar to wait for a table, there we had the most amazing empanadas and red sangria.####['managers', 'wait', 'sangria', 'bar', 'seat', 'empanadas']
you fry it in your batter and roll it up in spices, big chunky blue cheese makes them taste so nice's.####['spices', 'batter', 'chunky blue cheese']
we are laidback diners and as we've both waited tables, we tend to be forgiving of irregular service.####['service', 'tables', 'diners']
i have no idea what the food is like here, i only come for the frozen margaritas which i find to be the best i've found in the city and the grilled corn.####['food', 'grilled corn', 'frozen margaritas']
it took forever for the waiter to take my order as he was too busy chatting at the bar.####['bar', 'waiter']
the waitress apologized for the long wait and said they would give us some free drinks or desert since they forgot about our orders but we never received anything and by the time we got the bill we just wanted to pay and leave.####['waitress', 'drinks']
the price is well worth the quality and quantity of food.####['food', 'price', 'quality', 'quantity']
my friend and i walked in to an over crowded bar and were warned of a 45 minute wait.####['bar', 'wait']
count on fresh, fairly priced cuts of fish that represent a good value, even if portions are a bit on the small side.####['portions', 'fish']
even with our reservation, they had us waiting at the bar for over an hour.####['bar', 'reservation', 'waiting']
most diners stick to hot (shredded chicken breast in garlic and walnut sauce) and cold (briny tapenade, made with greek olives, capers and anchovies) meze, served in handsome vintage dishes.####['shredded chicken breast in garlic', 'dishes', 'greek olives']
seated just after 2; i commend them 'cause they were the only decent brunch spot that would take our reservation, and they did their best to seat us promptly.####['reservation', 'brunch spot']
after the grilled calamari, we got onion soup that had no soup, a dish of beans that had no flavor, the kitchen didn't make one of the three pasta dishes ordered, and the pork chop and other main dishes were not very good.####['pork chop', 'flavor', 'beans', 'onion soup']
the servers were prompt and attentive, but the food arrived lukewarm (maybe it was served so quickly because it was pre-cooked and had been sitting out for a while) and was not all that flavorful.####['food', 'served']
like the other bromberg brothers establishments, expect the customer is always wrong attitude from the staff along with overpriced wines you never heard of, no bar, tiny waiting area and lousy desserts.####['staff', 'customer', 'desserts', 'bar', 'waiting area', 'wines']
my friend also knew the chef, so we had some other courses not on the menu, but even knowing the chef didn't get us the service i would expect at this type of restaurant.####['service', 'menu']
first, the seating people gave me huge attitude and claimed i had not reserved a table at the grotto - and i quote my reservation you are all set for the grotta this saturday.####['reservation', 'seating people']
getting into the steak frites takes some sawing, but once cut, the meat is flavorful, if in need of salt.####['steak frites', 'meat']
i liked the place and the people, but we really went to have dinner no appetizers as the whole dinner.####['appetizers', 'place', 'people']
and if that wasn't enough the owner threw in a free beer each for me and my friend.####['beer', 'owner']
other small dishes, such as the fragrant sesame oil-scented raw spicy tuna, are excellent with a beer-sized mug of cold oolong tea.####['dishes', 'tea', 'fragrant sesame oil-scented raw spicy tuna']
true, the ambiance is something out of goodfellas, but it the food and waiters are out of this world!####['food', 'ambiance', 'waiters']
i was impressed with every dish and was tempted to go back for dinner that night!####['dish', 'dinner']
junk food place that could do well with a good cleaning.####['cleaning', 'food place']
there's even a nice menu of savory items served during late lunch and dinner hours.####['savory items served', 'dinner hours']
the numbness in your lower legs from sitting on old wood chairs is more than compensated by the wonderful food.####['food', 'wood chairs']
they kept the chef, margarita machines, and practically the identical menu from miracle grill (the restaurant that formerly had the space); how is it that everything here is so much worse?####['grill', 'space', 'menu']
i like to drink a variety of teas, but i've had some here that are really weird that i would avoid next time.####['drink', 'time']
the organic free range chicken was a 6, the lamb chop was excellent, and we had to send the halibut back 2x with no result- ended up having to order anther dish (cod) in which the fish was good but the clams were too tough to eat and the sausage wasn't even finished cooking (thus could not be consumed).####['fish', 'lamb chop', 'sausage', 'dish', 'organic free range chicken']
the drinks are very pricey and small, and the food is ok - but the portion size for the price is outrageous.####['drinks', 'portion size']
my date and i were both taken back by the lack of the friendly attitude from the owner of the restaurant.####['owner', 'attitude']
first, the waiter brought us to a table where people were still finishing their coffee from their meal - he told them the restaurant was busy and they needed to finish now and to pay their bill inside.####['meal', 'waiter']
our lovely waiter sent us off with scones for breakfast the following am!####['waiter', 'breakfast']
for entree i would recommand the rabbit curry - the meat was cooked very finely and the curry sauce, though a bit too sweet, went well with rice.####['rabbit curry', 'meat', 'entree', 'curry sauce']
after a crazy day @ work, with no reservation, we were so lucky to score a seat at the bar on an incredibly busy evening.####['bar', 'reservation', 'seat', 'evening']
besides, vegetarian or not, there are always ways to liven up food without compromising the healthy aspect.####['food', 'aspect']
i read about this place in the post, but never stepped foot in it i ordered a red velvet cake to be delivered to lower manhattan; it got there, and the broads at the office raved about it!####['red velvet cake', 'broads']
if you are undecided about which sandwich to choose, go for the indecision, which is a trio of smaller sandwiches on the menu.####['indecision', 'sandwiches', 'menu']
if you had good service there, try to get your waiter's name and request him/her by name the next time.####['service', 'waiter']
i prefer to sit at the bar as i don't have to listen to loud, boring conversations from the next table who always seem to be friends of the owner.####['next table', 'bar', 'owner']
the waiter spent a long time telling us about the menu (and more about his own life history in the process.####['waiter', 'menu']
we had a nice bottle of wine, dinner, and dessert for under $200.####['dessert', 'dinner', 'bottle of wine']
everything on the menu is satisfyingly savory, from a simple pot of mussels in a choice of sauces (beer-and-bacon, creamy mushroom, or white-wine-and-garlic broth), to beef stewed with beer and prunes, to a juicy croque-monsieur, and beyond.####['white-wine-and-garlic broth', 'mussels', 'menu', 'pot', 'beef stewed']
the wait staff didn't bother to refill my water until i had finish mine and was almost done with my husband's glass too.####['water', 'wait staff']
yes, this place is good, a cut above some of the other local diner food and a nice, friendly atmosphere.####['place', 'diner food', 'atmosphere']
since we're informed its service isslow we had dinner in midtownwent for dessertb-day thing.####['service', 'dinner']
it's one of our take-out staples because of the good food, fast delivery time and the cheap price (for under $25 we have a dinner for 2 and with left-overs).####['dinner', 'take-out staples', 'food', 'price', 'delivery']
too late to get a reservation so we went upstairs where initially the crowded scene threw me for a loop.####['reservation', 'scene']
the scene  chief among the neighborhood's bustling cafes is kolonaki, with its inviting upstairs space, replete with rich, dark wood tables and windowsills.####['upstairs space', 'wood tables', 'scene']
the texture of their flat noodles is something that has to be experienced to understand.####['texture', 'flat noodles']
although, we were seated within an hour, the bartender and waiter were very nice and the food was good (although my pork was too salty) we would not return.####['food', 'pork']
the only blemish was our waitress, who left us with empty drinks for quite a long time.####['waitress', 'drinks']
we (naturally) asked for a discount when the bill came, and our waitress disappeared for a moment and offered us.####['waitress', 'discount']
when the bill finally arrived, the head waiter sternly told us that this time is okay, but next time you have to order more than 2 appitizers and a main course!####['appitizers', 'waiter']
the menu looked great, but the food was the biggest disappointment i've had yet!####['food', 'menu']
we waited in standing at the entrance for 5 mins to get seats due to just slow service, another 10mins to get menu, and then another 10mins to get water bread.####['service', 'bread', 'menu']
the wait staff is very attentive, and you can smoke at the bar while enjoying the view of the river.####['bar', 'wait staff']
i complained to the manager who offered to move us and pay for our appetizers.####['appetizers', 'manager']
we were not seated by a hostess (and as a result didn't receive menus or water for a good while) and were rushed out as the restaurant closed an hour after we arrived.####['menus', 'hostess']
when i requested a change to the non-smoking section, the waiter replied that there were no open tables.####['tables', 'waiter']
when we showed up, the guy at the door said it would be 15 minutes and that we could wait by the bar.####['guy', 'bar']
caffeine addicts will have to find their fix elsewhere as coffee is curiously not on the menu, but the singha beer and decent wine list more than compensates.####['wine list', 'menu']
good value for money--especially the $7 lunch special for 2 courses.####['courses', 'value for money']
dinner is a tad dodgy, especially if you don't eat meat or fish.####['meat', 'dinner']
the food is decent but small portions so expect to order a lot.####['food', 'portions']
comfort is decidedly not a factor in the arturo's experience--once patrons escape the bottleneck near the bar, they're shoehorned into a miniscule dining room.####['bar', 'comfort']
then the huffy hostess when we asked to be seated at a table not directly on-top of another couple.####['table', 'hostess']
remember the 80's when you have to wait 1-2 hours for a table even though you have a reservation + the wait staff treated you like the idiot that you are for paying $2-300 per head for this treatment, then you should definately come to experience this jewel!!####['reservation', 'table', 'wait staff']
on the other hand, the food was good but not awesome as had been described, furthermore i found the portions fairly small for this type of restaurant.####['food', 'portions']
the owner don greeted us at the door with a warm smile, and seated us for dinner upstairs.####['owner', 'dinner']
our waitress couldn't tell us what was in the seafood special, forgot to put in our oyster order so it came at the same time as the main meals, wasn't able to provide a confident recommendation from the menu, and had to be flagged several times for drinks.####['waitress', 'drinks', 'menu', 'main meals']

flavorful indian favorites like vegetable pakora, lamb tikka masala and tandoori chicken, as well as unexpected offerings such as alaska king crab legs and fried coconut shrimp, are served at extremely reasonable prices.####['lamb tikka masala and tandoori chicken', 'vegetable pakora', 'prices', 'alaska king crab legs and fried coconut shrimp']
the food is on the good side but not so terrific to compensate the bad service, crammed tiny-tables, dirty glasses, overly loud music, which is good for the bar part of the establishment but not when you want to seat down, eat and have a normal conversation at normal volume.####['service', 'food', 'glasses']
i was disappointed to hear another waiter (or it could've been the owner) was reading completely different specials (most of which i would've wanted to try if i didn't overhear at the end of our meal) to the table next to us.####['waiter', 'owner', 'specials']
our waiter from last year, a young man named chris, actually remembered us (we did speak at length that evening about everything from food and wine to how to create good marrige).####['waiter', 'wine']
as a chef i really appreciated the well executed dishes that were full of crisp and vibrant flavor contrast acting in harmony and perfect balance.####['chef', 'dishes', 'flavor']
the service can be a bit spotty since they are sometimes busy taking phone orders to attend to the restaurant patrons so make sure you have a lot of time to spare when you go there for dinner.####['service', 'dinner']
atmosphere is not that relaxing, if you go - you must bring a cell phone and go down the street for a drink.####['drink', 'atmosphere']
this pizza shop is one o fhte best places ever and is a hiden gem in a small community.####['pizza', 'community']

the tables weren't bussed and they forgot to make my chai tea, which wasn't all that delicious, not was my friend's coffee.####['tables', 'coffee']
service is fast so if you are dining, order entrees after receiving apps.####['service', 'entrees']
upon finishing our meal that same waitress that ignored us, suddenly appeared at our table asking if we needed our check, we were finishing our coffee and drinks, yet she was blatantly trying to get us out so that the table could be turned over.####['waitress', 'drinks']
the kinds of places like this where strangers are likely to share a table during the lunch rush always have better food than the table-cloth places.####['food', 'lunch']

our waiter recommended thzt we share a few of the appetizers; they were great.####['appetizers', 'waiter']
i went here for a fun dinner with friends - they do not take reservations during the week, but we were seated pretty swiftly for a friday night, having had a delicious glass of spanish wine at the bar.####['bar', 'dinner', 'glass of spanish wine']
we were just settling the bill, when a waiter i can only assume held a controlling interest in the restaurant (else he would've been fired long ago) came to the table and demanded to know why someone (our friend who'd briefly left to use the restroom) had left her beer half-full.####['half-full', 'waiter', 'bill']
my only gripe was that the food was all in big bins, but that's expected for a lunch rush hour type crowd.####['lunch', 'crowd']
i've been here twice for brunch, and i found the ambience and food to be much better than the overly-hyped kitchenette next door.####['ambience', 'brunch']
the food is just ok, not really memorable and not what you expect for the price but i guess the atmosphere is what you pay for.####['food', 'price', 'atmosphere']
what i liked the most is that the staff listened attentively to what i asked for and my meal was prepared exactly the way i asked, what a treat.####['meal', 'staff']
the drinks were water down and the only big thing was the bill.####['drinks', 'bill']
its not cheap, it was $10 for a burger and fries, and when i was there, the waiter had dropped a full glass of coke on a patron, soaking her through!####['glass', 'waiter', 'burger']
our bill total was only $30 and our waiter threw in a side of linguini (no charge) since the entrees don't come with pasta sides.####['pasta sides', 'entrees', 'waiter', 'bill']
the reservation was easy enough to make the night before for a saturday night (after the pre-theater crowd).####['reservation', 'crowd']
there was 3 baby carrots, a spoon full of spinach, sun dried tomatoes, 3 pieces of eggplant, and 10 string beans, oh and onions.####['onions', 'baby carrots', 'sun dried tomatoes', 'spinach', 'eggplant']

decor is sort of homey, with mismatched tables and plates.####['tables', 'decor']
generally one would have to point out to the waitstaff the beer was flat and ask for another.####['waitstaff', 'beer']
though we had to wait about 45 minutes from our dinner reservation time, we were given breadsticks, olives and parmasean to nibble on while we waited, albeit in the very cramped bar area.####['bar area', 'olives']
finally, one of the waitstaff noticed and brought out a dirty bus pan which he put on the table next to me and started bussing the entire dining room.####['waitstaff', 'dining room']

the menu features such sumptuous fare as lobster ravioli in a light aurora sauce, double-cut grilled veal chop with an aromatic salsa verde, and octopus salad with steamed potato, red onions, and caper berries.####['double-cut grilled veal chop', 'aromatic salsa verde', 'berries', 'fare', 'lobster ravioli in a light aurora sauce', 'menu', 'octopus salad with steamed potato, red onions']
the soft shell chicken taco is alright, but nobody would go here for serious mexican food.####['soft shell chicken taco', 'mexican food']
i asked the waitress what this was for and her responses were as follows: we put in an extra shot, we had to use ice in the drink, and it must have been the computer.####['waitress', 'drink']
the bill came out to quite a lot though, considering there were 14 of us some of us ordered way too many drinks.####['drinks', 'bill']
although the waitress had clearly our reservation on her book, she told us somebody arrived one minute ago and being first to arrive, he could have our table.####['waitress', 'reservation']
the food guiltily scarf down fried catfish sandwiches and collard greens, or try clinton's favorite: short ribs and fried chicken.####['collard greens', 'ribs', 'fried catfish sandwiches', 'fried chicken']
the waitress took about 20 minutes to bring us the menu.####['waitress', 'menu']
after arriving an hour early for our reservation for 2 and politely asking for a table near the band we were promptly seated at one of the worst tables in the place.####['tables', 'reservation', 'band']
we ordered simple salads, which were outrageous in price and def.####['salads', 'price']
it's just nice to have a place like this - a sit down place with a lot of food choices, not centered on a particular ethnicity and a bar - as an option here.####['bar', 'food choices']
there were a few moments during the tasting menu that left me speechless, such as the shrimp in cream sauce, toro with foam, foie gras custard, eggplant in miso and a foie gras kobe beef filet fried ball that brought me to tears.####['shrimp in cream sauce', 'eggplant in miso', 'menu', 'moments']
all dishes have been adjusted for american preferences (bland, missing spices and wok heat).####['dishes', 'spices']

we waited forever for our bill but did have a nice conversation with one of our waitstaff during our meal.####['waitstaff', 'bill']
watch out for the sesame noodles, though, and leave the complimentary pickled cabbage and carrots sitting on the table for the next customer to enjoy.####['table', 'sesame noodles']
my fiance and i always get mussels a la cono and linguine a la cono, but all the other pasta dishes i've tried have been good or excellent.####['pasta dishes', 'mussels']
i would say that the atmosphere was nothing amazing, i didn't feel like the authenticity of the history of the place was nearly as prevelant as it could have been in the experience.####['place', 'atmosphere']
if it's not on the menu, ask for the string bean and goat cheese salad- delicious.####['string bean and goat cheese', 'menu']

when i politely asked for a water he pointed to the waiter and looked the other way!####['waiter', 'water']
waiters take your order and you don't get your food for at least 1 hour so you can prchase drinks.####['food', 'drinks', 'waiters']

we got so frustrated with our waitress, who stopped by twice over the course of 2 1/2 hours, that we had to order everything from the bar.####['waitress', 'bar']
the complete and total rudeness and frustration surrounding this place started with the hostess calling us in the middle of the afternoon asking if we could change our reservation.####['reservation', 'hostess', 'afternoon']
however, the appetizers i've tried (rolls, calamari, fish fingers) were really delicious.####['appetizers', 'fish', 'calamari', 'rolls']
service was reasonably quick via delivery, but the hunan beef had no spice whatsoever and the chicken chow mein really looked inedible.####['hunan beef', 'delivery']
go have a drink there the space is beautiful and buy an appetizer maybe, but pass on dinner, not well cooked and small portions.####['space', 'portions', 'appetizer', 'dinner']

food was so-so, but it was the most awful dinner i experienced in my life.####['food', 'dinner']
for a menu in a similar price range with some similar items, but mostly unique entrees, try the less formal toast 13 or so blocks north on the same side of broadway.####['price range', 'entrees']
the feeling of unwelcomeness was especially prevalent due to the fact that our waiter hovered over our table and immediately cleared the table of dishes and glasses, some of which were still full in order to get us out the door asap.####['waiter', 'table of dishes']
they seem under staffed and waiters do not really know the menu.####['waiters', 'menu']
the manager (or someone very important that was able to be seated 1/2 hour before opening) sat in the corner, with a glass of wine, a date, and talked on his cell for about an hour, loudly, while the first arrivals were sent to the hotel tearoom next door.####['glass of wine', 'manager', 'corner']
it still took a little while to get our drinks and food - but the atmosphere made up for it.####['drinks', 'atmosphere']
manager couldn't be bothered to come over and acknowledge the mistake.####['mistake', 'manager']
this place has great ribs, not to mention hot waitresses, its a great place to meet for drinks and dinner before you go out, but it does turn into a bit of a sausage fest on the weekends.####['dinner', 'sausage fest', 'drinks', 'ribs', 'waitresses']
you may as well just extend the bar into the restaurant since it has already penetrated it with loud music, loud voices, and a remarkable amount of cigarette smoke.####['music', 'bar', 'smoke']

the server (jasmine) checked up on us periodically and was patient as she explained certain menu items.####['server', 'menu items']
the waitress saw a couple of us struggling with the menu and i felt she was frustrated with us.####['waitress', 'menu']
the service was unattentive and the only time she came over was to aggressively push drinks on us.####['service', 'drinks']
however, unlike a lot of places the service was great: we walked in after not being able to get a reservation and were seated within 10 mins.####['service', 'reservation']
i asked the waiter to move us to another table because we didn't want to rush our meal.####['meal', 'waiter', 'table']
the waitress was friendly but did not know the menu and had to run to the kitchen after each question.####['waitress', 'menu']
it is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.####['tables', 'atmosphere']
the drinkers beside us had fresh glasses of water brought on trays to replace the empties and a smiling waitress to cater to their every whim.####['waitress', 'trays', 'drinkers']

i'm not going to trash the place simply because i had a bad experience there, but here's the facts: the food is very good, the portions are small-to-medium, and the prices are large.####['food', 'place', 'portions', 'prices']
spoke with the manager about comping a round, after we had already paid for 2 rounds waiting for the table.####['table', 'manager', 'waiting']
my boyfriend and i loved imagine bar and grill.####['grill', 'bar']

the waiter brought out the same dish three times during the meal.####['meal', 'waiter']
students, artists, and young parents with their tots in tow linger all day on the mismatched couches and chairs--the place closes way too early to lure a late-night crowd.####['couches', 'chairs']

i would only go back for a lobster roll at lunch.####['lunch', 'lobster roll']
the ambience and service here are great but the food was really awful.####['service', 'food']
for a 4-star restaurant (not to mention a $400 dinner for two), attentive service is expected.####['service', 'dinner']
our waiter (who also seemed to be the manager) dropped red wine all over me the contents of my purse and all he did was apologize quickly, hand me some club soda and avoid me for the rest of the time i was there.####['club soda', 'waiter', 'manager']
my only complaint was the ginger iced tea was too sugary - but the home-made fresh lemonade was very tasty and fresh.####['ginger iced tea', 'home-made fresh lemonade']
beyond the green awning and floor-to-ceiling windows, sophisticated (and often european) patrons drink wine from the bar in back and dine on french fare like nicoise salad, foie gras, and steak tartare at tightly packed tables.####['drink wine', 'tables', 'french fare', 'bar', 'steak tartare', 'dine']
definitely try their pizzas and wines--although their desserts are not-to-shabby either.####['wines', 'pizzas', 'desserts']

if you want to go there only go for drinks and the atmosphere b/c the food is definitly not worth it!!####['drinks', 'food']
the appetizers were delicious and the entrees were superb (the mahi was a little bland, but i guess you can't win them all).####['appetizers', 'entrees', 'mahi']
the ambience isn't great but the food is so tasty and so reasonably priced that it's definitely a fun date place if you want to get a bunch of stuff and sample.####['ambience', 'priced', 'food']

our waitress took our order and then never came back to our table.####['waitress', 'table']
for appetizers we ordered chicken samosas and lasooni gobi and for main course we ordered chicken tikka masala, lamb pasanda and saag paneer they were all just scrumptious.####['appetizers', 'lamb pasanda', 'saag paneer', 'chicken tikka masala']
the atmosphere was nice in the front room, but despite a reservation, we were relegated to the rear, where we were treated like stepchildren - we had to flag someone down to take our order, water with no ice, we had to ask for extras (as opposed to someone asking if we needed something else).####['reservation', 'atmosphere']
the owner addressed me by my first name after my second visit the garlic shrimp is a hit and the sangria ( the bartender on fridays mixes the drink in three ways).####['drink', 'garlic shrimp', 'owner', 'bartender']

) and don't forget the svc, those waiters stare at you your entire meal, just waiting for you to put your fork down and they snatch the plate away in a second.####['meal', 'fork', 'waiters', 'waiting']
the waitress really struggled with anything more complicated than that--not sure if it was a language problem or what, but 3 of the 4 drinks we ordered came both late and wrong, including beer brought in place of a cocktail, the wrong wine, and a mystery drink that nobody had ordered.####['waitress', 'mystery drink', 'cocktail', 'drinks', 'beer', 'wine']

music was blasting (speakers located practically on top of every table), and we asked the waitress if they can turn it down.####['music', 'waitress']
the scene though plenty of white-washed tables and chairs are scattered about the dining room, it's the bar that acts as a neighborhood gathering place.####['chairs', 'tables', 'dining room', 'bar', 'scene']
