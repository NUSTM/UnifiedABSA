when i got home, there was a message on the machine because the owner realized that our waitress forgot to charge us for our wine.####['waitress', 'owner', 'wine']

we all liked the brunch items we had but when we later asked if the chips were supposed to come with the meal, the waitress explained it away by saying sometimes they forget instead of apologizing and offering something extra.####['waitress', 'brunch', 'chips']
appetizers are the safest bet, including a bountiful calamari plate or the appropriately earthy mushroom polenta.####['appetizers', 'bountiful calamari plate', 'appropriately earthy mushroom polenta']

the portions were kid sized and we spent about $100 a person in cluding wine (4 of us).####['portions', 'cluding wine']
my only quibbles are service - which was confused (we waited 10 minutes for menus), and the wine list, which is over-the-top expensive.####['service', 'wine list', 'menus']
the waiter made a huge production over what order he should deliver the food, as we all agreed the miso should be eaten with the sushi to aid digestion.####['waiter', 'sushi']

especially the manager or host who kept walking by and giving us the evil eye to see the progress of our dinner so they could turn the table over to other customers.####['dinner', 'manager', 'host']
the salad was good but my friends hardly ate their pasta.####['salad', 'pasta']
the chicken breast with mole sauce, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo is a delicious main course and quite filling.####['sour cream and pico de', 'chicken breast with mole sauce', 'guacamole']

we hunted the waitress to at least pay for the drinks.####['waitress', 'drinks']

i ordered the fried catfish, which had very little to no seasoning, the yams, and mac and cheese which were just okay.####['mac and cheese', 'yams', 'seasoning', 'fried catfish']
when the manager came to our table at the end of the meal and asked how our experience was, i complained to him about the cold.####['table', 'cold', 'manager']

maybe i've just gotten lucky with seating, but i've never had more than a ten minute wait.####['seating', 'wait']
so are cooked plates: marinated kobe beef practically melts on its skewers, soy-buttered scallops collapse with sweet brine and chawanmushi custard, quivering in eel-soy broth with black truffles and foie gras, is over the top.####['marinated kobe beef', 'scallops collapse', 'eel-soy broth with black truffles and foie gras', 'plates']
after all that, the waiter tried to backpedal saying its too hard to time the cooking of miso soup with the sushi bar offerings.####['waiter', 'cooking of miso soup']
start by enjoying the atmosphere while having a glass of wine at the bar and we you are ready, go and enjoy your food!####['bar', 'atmosphere']

in retrospect, that was kind of foolish, as the portions for dinner were obscene.####['portions', 'dinner']
the mango salsa with fish cake was too sour, the apple suace for pork chop too sweet.####['apple suace', 'mango salsa with fish cake', 'pork chop']
the service was rather slow but our waiter was very pleasant and obliging.####['service', 'waiter']
if you don't mind interacting with sour-puss employees, then by all means, enjoy the treats at sweet melissa.####['treats', 'employees']

at 1:15 we were still waiting for our plates!####['waiting', 'plates']
we sat at the bar and were constantly bumped by the waitress flying past; had fabulously fresh raw oysters with pieces of shell in every bite; lobsters rolls were tasty but the large pieces of meat were tough; the apple crumble was excellent but the ice cream was over-frozen and the stench of frying oil was nearly unbearable.####['waitress', 'ice cream', 'bar', 'rolls']
half the menu is comprised of original creations while the other half consists of unique slants on orthodox cuisine such as the single super-sized gnocchi with cinammon.####['gnocchi', 'menu']
for manhattanites like us that are used to pretentious attitudes and expensive tabs, this place is definitely a nice change from the rest of the meatpacking district.####['attitudes', 'district']
the pancakes were good, but don't have blueberry pancakes on the menu of you are not able to produce more than three tiny blueberries in each pancake.####['blueberry pancakes', 'menu']
i had reservations for 9:30pm and after waiting more that 50 mins and bunch of lies that you're next.####['reservations', 'waiting']
otoro tuna, gorgeously marbled with fat, is captivating; hamachi sashimi, topped by the chef with a whisper of sea salt and a barely-there squeeze of lemon, creates eye-rolling pleasure.####['chef', 'sea salt', 'pleasure', 'otoro tuna', 'sashimi', 'whisper']
dropped in for a quick bite with a friend -- like the previous reviewer it took more than 15 minutes for any kind of service at all (including getting water) and then another 45 minutes to get a burger (which admittedly was good).####['service', 'water']
great pizza for lunch place.####['pizza', 'lunch']
seems everyone ordered sushi there were tons of delivery orders (we can tell as we sat near the back).####['sushi', 'delivery']

the round pizza doesn't taste as good as i recall, it's still wonderful, but the sicilian is to die for.####['round pizza', 'sicilian']
i'm also a big fan of the chicken pizza on their new bar menu (no bread - weird, huh?####['bread', 'new bar menu']
start with fennel-fragrant grilled sardines and the extraordinary pastas, such as poppy-seeded sweet beet ravioli, brown-butter-slicked squash tortelli, and airy swiss chard-ricotta malfatti (misshapen gnocchi with fried sage).####['fennel-fragrant grilled sardines', 'brown-butter-slicked squash tortelli', 'swiss chard-ricotta', 'pastas', 'sweet beet ravioli']
although i didn't pay for the meal (and it's about $22 bucks a plate, way over my normal eating range), i have to say that it was better than any food i've ever had in little italy, and there weren't any touristy elements to be found.####['range', 'food']
but servers, attentive if slightly unpolished, gladly direct inquisitors to menu strengths--like rum-flambeed dessert bananas foster--and allow leisurely enjoyment.####['servers', 'menu']
i'm totally into the space-age vibe of this place, but i wish they had more tables to sit down at.####['tables', 'vibe']
ask for a table closer to the bar than in back of the dining area; the drop ceiling the back compromises enjoying the soaring space of guastavino's.####['space', 'bar', 'drop ceiling']
when we got our bill the drinks were full priced and when we asked, our waitress said that there is no happy hour on the roof.####['waitress', 'drinks', 'bill']
the hostess was condescending and the waiter was somewhat absent and unaccomodating (sure, we made a reservation to sit outside but when i asked to be moved indoors after i heard thunder he didn't even try to make it happen, giving me a blank stare and a shrug when i asked what we would do if it rained).####['reservation', 'waiter', 'hostess']
the server was so busy the night we visited that she forgot to put in our food order.####['food', 'server']
the food the versatile austrian menu, fused with french and american, rewards both high and low-end appetites: rich, cheese-laden onion soup, grilled gruyere and country ham sandwiches and big-bunned burgers are as satisfying as velvety liver terrine with kumquat-cranberry compote, speck and sausage charcuterie and inexpensive cheese plates.####['french', 'versatile', 'kumquat-cranberry', 'cheese plates', 'speck', 'sausage', 'country ham sandwiches', 'liver terrine', 'food', 'menu', 'onion soup']

candles on the tables, cozy furnishings and music at just the right level make it a great dining experience.####['music', 'experience', 'candles', 'furnishings']
i always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu.####['waiter', 'menu']
my only complaint was that when i tried to go back with some friends on a crowded night, the place was packed, yet they told us there was a 20 minute wait and that we should wait at the bar.####['bar', 'place']
the wait for a table is interminable.####['table', 'wait']
great value for the price-- lunch is an even better value, with entree and appetizer for between $8-10 or so.####['lunch', 'price', 'appetizer']
having eaten here for lunch many times, i can definitely vouch this place for having some of the best per-slice pizza in the city.####['lunch', 'per-slice pizza']
the food and service was top notch, only the complain is that this place is so small that some seats are not made for a big guy.####['service', 'food', 'seats', 'guy']
went there for sunday brunch after a wonderful massage - the food was terrible-bland/tasteless, cold, expensive.####['food', 'brunch']
our waitress did not take our drink order until i finally flagged her down and even then she seemed disinterested in our meal.####['waitress', 'drink', 'meal']
wait staff have no room to get to tables because of overflow from bar area, and knocked into the back seats of our table constantly.####['bar area', 'wait staff']
the concoction was thrown away a mere two blocks from the bar.####['bar', 'concoction']
had the calamari app, which tgifriday's makes better, and the scallop ceviche - that is not ceviche!####['calamari app', 'scallop ceviche']
the decor could be a bit better, and if there was a small bar the overall atmosphere would be a bit more inviting (especially for regulars).####['bar', 'atmosphere', 'decor']
maybe it was the choices the chefs had put on the restaurant week menu, but much of our food was just so-so.####['food', 'menu']
i love the shrimp summer role, chicken kabob's, and all the chicken and shrimp dishes.####['shrimp summer role', 'shrimp dishes']
i got a steak special that was way overpriced ($12 more then the steak on the menu and no warning from the waitress) and it was cooked to the wrong temperature.####['waitress', 'temperature', 'steak special', 'menu']
if people are late, you could lose your reservation and/or the staff does pressure you to start ordering even if your whole party hasnt arrived.####['reservation', 'staff']
people will literally spend their entire lunch break waiting and for what - an average fastfood burger.####['lunch', 'burger', 'waiting']
if you like an ecclectic crowd and an overall good time where you and your friends can get together whether it be to eat, drink or just play some good old pictionary (they provide crayons and a blank white sheet at every table), go to the cargo!####['drink', 'time', 'sheet']
now a sleek, cool lounge with refreshing new color, lighting and surfaces, fig 27 mirrors its around the corner sibling, ps450 with a yummy menu of small bites, great drinks and wonderful staff.####['staff', 'mirrors', 'new color', 'lounge', 'drinks', 'menu']
we would rather pay more prices and expect the better food and service.####['food', 'prices']
we finally flagged down another server who brought us more to drink, and then they took forever with the check.####['drink', 'server']
when we asked a waiter for an explanation of the long wait with some many empty tables he had no answer so we asked for the manager.####['tables', 'waiter', 'manager']
went here late night after a a few drinks at my favorite watering spot and was amazed that a place which serves food till 4 can be so damned good.####['drinks', 'spot']
although she was obviously busy, she was helpful in describing certain items on the menu and suggested a duck dish that was out of this world.####['menu', 'duck dish']
the bartendars were right on top of getting us our wine and setting up free blue cheese dip and chips for us.####['wine', 'bartendars']
the lunch got a little bizarre when we asked the waiter how the joint got it's name, and he made his hands into cups in reference to placing them on a woman's breasts and said, no, not this.####['waiter', 'lunch']
the waitstaff are surprisingly uninformed and unintelligent, and i say this even though i liked my waiter.####['waitstaff', 'waiter']
right after we finished the main course (the organic chicken was dry), but before we finish drinking the wine the check was placed on the table, and the waitress came back and picked it up three times.####['waitress', 'wine', 'organic chicken']
the outdoor patio is really nice in good weather, but what ambience the indoors possesses is negated by the noise and the crowds.####['outdoor patio', 'ambience']
the food there's a trimmed-down version of the regular blue ribbon menu--all manner of sandwiches, and a solid selection of american main courses--but the real attraction is the vast, well-edited range of cheese, fish and vegetable portions (goodies like foie gras terrine aside, the meat selections are disappointingly indistinct).####['blue ribbon menu', 'vegetable portions', 'range of cheese', 'sandwiches', 'food']
most of the food has a vinegary flavor (i think because of the injera).####['food', 'flavor']
it does get crowded with plenty of blue shirted cigar smoking wannabes, so make a reservation.####['reservation', 'blue shirted cigar']
my bass was even worse - smothered in some kind of tomato sauce that just did not go with fish and the spinach that accompanied the dish was extremely dry and flavorless.####['fish', 'dish', 'bass', 'spinach', 'tomato sauce']
service was attentive at the beginning but the waiter lost us towards the end and we had to flag them down for the check.####['service', 'waiter']
for the price ($8), the quality of the buffet is great!####['quality of the buffet', 'price']
last, but not least, when we walked in, most of the clientelle was vietnamese and next to us was a food critic whose review was on the back of the menu.####['food', 'clientelle', 'menu']
the bottom line is that mercadito is all style and no substance (the drinks had far too much salad and seasoning in them.####['drinks', 'salad', 'seasoning']
the atmosphere was warm, sexy, and very romantic but the lighting wasn't good for reading the menu.####['lighting', 'menu', 'atmosphere']
after reading the negative sushi reviews, my boyfriend and i opted for their korean fare.####['korean fare', 'sushi']
with all of the kitchen goof-ups (appetizer coming out before the entree and one entree coming out ten minutes before the other) you would think that the wait staff would have been more attentive.####['appetizer', 'wait staff']
one entree from their restaraunt is enough to fill two adults, not to mention that all their dishes are out of this world.####['dishes', 'entree']
when i asked the waitress, she told me they couldn't afford the salmon, and had changed the dish (though not on the menu).####['waitress', 'dish', 'salmon']
i had reservations for a week but was seated at the worst table in the room,against a wall near the entrance to the kitchen,very claustaphobic.####['reservations', 'table in the room']
the food was a mix of sandwiches, salads and appetizers that were mostly healthy and had a nice brazilian touch.####['appetizers', 'food', 'salads', 'mix of sandwiches']
my vegetable napoleon was good; although i first got the veggie burger because the waitress mis-heard and stood my friend up for another 15 minutes of waiting to have it served.####['veggie burger', 'vegetable napoleon', 'waiting']

the huge terrace is just so beautiful--and rumor has it they'll be tenting the space this fall, so we midtowners can continue to dine outside through the end of the year.####['terrace', 'space']
about 10 minutes apart each, so we were all eating cold eggs by the time we got our food.####['eggs', 'food']
after demanding a free round of drinks from a third manager, our party decided to bail on this horrific french import.####['drinks', 'manager']
been there a few times for dinner, brunch or just a drink (the french cosmos are fantastic) and it just keeps getting better.####['french cosmos', 'drink', 'dinner']
steak - porterhouse for 2 was served for 1, overspiced, overpriced and tasted frozen, with a hint of msg dessert - best part of meal, good espresso overall - if food quality matters to you over pretty lights and models handing you towels in the bathroom, i don't recommend.####['food quality', 'msg dessert']
they served the salad and the main course together and didn't even bring the dessert menu.####['salad', 'main course', 'dessert menu']
this happened while many diners were enjoying their meal and it was rudes.####['meal', 'diners']

we preferred to gaze at our burgers while avoiding having to look at the wait staff, but no complaints.####['wait staff', 'burgers']

when my (pregnant) friend asked about a non-alcoholic version of a drink, the answer was simply no, with no further suggestions.####['answer', 'drink']
i think friends coffee shop makes great food the service is great and they are very poilte i think that they should open more because there the best food store i ever ate from the food is addicting and you cant stop eating because it so delious.####['service', 'coffee']

deserts were slow to order as waiters passed us twice, even with the menus closed.####['menus closed', 'deserts', 'waiters']

the waiter didn't recommen any special for the night, didn't come back to the table to check if everything is okay, didn't even offer me the dessert menu at the end.####['dessert menu', 'waiter', 'table']
the trick to the tomato and onions is ask for it light on the onions, heavy on the tomatoes, order steak for one less person than you have in your party and if the steak is too rare, you can cook the individual pieces more by placing them on the platter around the edges.####['tomatoes', 'tomato and onions']
my party felt like we got put in a dining room for tourist, which must have been the penalty box area for the disgruntled wait staff on duty.####['dining room', 'wait staff']
then the manager gave us lemon juice instead of ceasar dressing for a ceasar salad which ruined the salad.####['lemon juice', 'manager', 'ceasar dressing']
the scene you won't blink twice at the restaurant's spartan decor: as the packed crowds and critics' praises wallpapering the front wall agree, this longtime local favorite is truly one of the area's most exquisite finds.####['decor', 'scene']
but on a recent sunday brunch excursion, i was greeted by a uniformly unfriendly staff - starting with the hostess and extending to foul faced wait staff.####['brunch', 'hostess', 'wait staff']

only thing we didn't like was the steamed chocolate cake with mint ice creama group of the 4 of us did not want to finish this dessert!####['dessert', 'steamed chocolate cake with mint ice']
the situation was verified by taking 3 dishes that were over an hour late off the bill and free desserts and coffee but the experience left most of us never wanting to go to the supposed hip cool 66 ever again.####['dishes', 'desserts', 'bill']
the perfect meal; delux combo raw bar as an appetizer, king crab as your entree.####['meal', 'bar', 'king crab']

food was average, the appetizers were better than the main courses.####['appetizers', 'main courses']
sure the food was - as always - very good, but we were quite outrageous about the waitress.####['waitress', 'food']
i go there to eat dinner, brunch, or to just drink and hang out at the bar with the friendly staff.####['drink', 'bar', 'staff', 'dinner']
my husband and i had dinner here last week and the food was very good.####['food', 'dinner']
bouley has done an excellent job creating this dining establishment with almost a museum sense, the artworks on the wall have a very klimty feeling and the gold ceiling completes the rest of the experience.####['dining establishment', 'gold ceiling', 'artworks']

we live down the street and have eaten here many times for lunch and dinner, and the food is consistently terrific.####['food', 'lunch', 'dinner']

the service was great, the chef even gave me a complimentary dish.####['service', 'dish', 'chef']
we asked for bread plates when the bread was brought to the table and the server's response was management has decided not to offer bread plates.####['table', 'server', 'management']

the place has an awesome decore, with fish swiming below certain tables.####['tables', 'decore', 'fish']

lobster ceviche was amazing pared with mango.####['mango', 'lobster ceviche']

prices are reasonable, probably $55/pp with appetizers, main course, dessert and a drink.####['appetizers', 'drink', 'main course', 'prices']

there is nothing else on the menu except for exotic teas and cold beverages, but with a meal this cheap and delightful, who would care?####['meal', 'exotic teas', 'beverages', 'menu']
the servers were snobby and got mad at me when i asked if they serve by the slice.####['servers', 'slice']
i have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.####['reservations', 'choices', 'food', 'menu']

shun lee has been serving creative chinese food in a deluxe dining room for 30 years--they must be doing something right!####['deluxe dining room', 'chinese food']
the smoked salmon appetizer was pretty good (it comes with goat cheese, calpers and onions).####['goat cheese', 'onions', 'smoked salmon appetizer']
the staff was courteous and explained the menu with detail.####['detail', 'staff']
reservations are no guarantee of prompt seating, have a pre-game drink, pop a xanax and you can handle the drama of having a res and getting no love from the hostess.####['reservations', 'pre-game drink', 'hostess']
soy abounds, in all forms: as firm patties, pure squares of glistening tofu, and something called a hijiki patty--mixed tastily with shreds of seaweed, then fried.####['patties', 'mixed', 'tofu']
there's always people waiting to be seated and the chairs are not comfortable.####['chairs', 'waiting']
the host was playing god with his headset and reservation list, the bar was packed with horney drunken investment bankers, reservations are a joke and after haplessly sliding the plates at us when serving the food, they couldn't wait to collect the plates until we were done.####['reservations', 'food', 'bar']
instead, yasuda's swarm of waiters and waitresses hovered incessantly overhead, seizing any opportunity to fill a glass, reorganize the table, ask if we were done, and of course clear us out of there in under 80 min.####['glass', 'waitresses']

our waitress was a bit cold but she was still attentive and food came quickly.####['waitress', 'food']

the food the classic italian menu gets off to a good start with queen's famous bread basket, which is loaded with a slew of crunchy, yeasty homemade varieties.####['food', 'bread', 'italian menu', 'varieties']
that's almost enough to prove its legitimacy to me, but eating there, both for a quick slice and sit-down for pasta with my family has always been a delicious, inexpensive and fun experience.####['pasta', 'family']
mac cheese is nothing to write home about; the beet salad is boring, mostly lettuce; tuna sandwhich - boring, mostly mayo; the french fries looked re-fried and were cold; the excellent pork sandwich came on one of those supermarket hot-dog buns.####['beet salad', 'mac cheese', 'tuna sandwhich']
ok i got the edamame and something from the sushi chef for free, but the quality of food is more important to me than a free small dish (maybe that's why the restaurant gives it to attact new customers.####['quality of food', 'edamame', 'dish', 'sushi chef']
we were directed to a table by a member of staff, which we were then informed was reserved, and lost our seats at the bar, all this after spending upwards of $30 each on very expensive drinks over a two-hour period.####['bar', 'table', 'staff', 'seats']
after our meal,the manager, even took some of his time to sit with us and give us a lesson in sake 101.####['meal', 'manager']

we were in haven from appetizers, my favorite was the tuna tartare, to the dim sum,the best was shrimp and foie gras dumpling, and i could go on and on, everything was an explosion of flavors.####['appetizers', 'foie gras dumpling', 'flavors', 'dim sum', 'shrimp', 'tuna tartare']
the prices seemed reasonable with entrees ranging from $14-$25.####['entrees', 'prices']
it would be better to place the bar closer to the front of the restaurant and away from the tables.####['tables', 'bar', 'front']
we wanted to join another 2 top table to ours and the manager abruptly said, that won't work for us!####['table', 'manager']
the only drawback was slow service, but the food and ambience are so nice that your wait is a) pleasant and b) worth it.####['service', 'food', 'ambience', 'wait']
i like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.####['chole', 'somosas', 'dhal', 'dhosas', 'chai']
dinner is okay - not many vegetarian options, and the portions are small.####['portions', 'dinner']
not a destination restaurant, but if you're hungry for breakfast or lunch, big portions and good quality for the money.####['portions', 'quality', 'breakfast']
had a dinner date (her suggestion) :) had the mussels (really good) and smoked salmon (not the best) for appys.####['appys', 'smoked salmon', 'mussels']
in short the vegi burgers (and the full bar) are the main draws: ranging from the super veg-burger with lettuce, tomato and abijah's secret sauce to the mckate (two un-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, dairy or nondairy cheese, etc.####['tomato', "abijah's secret sauce", 'un-beef patties', 'full bar']

between the seven of us we sampled just about everything on the menu, and nothing disappointed (ribs pulled pork seemed like the biggest hits).####['ribs', 'pork', 'menu']
however, when our waitress realized her faux pas, an extra glass of wine was sent to our table and all was forgiven.####['waitress', 'table', 'glass of wine']
the food the mediterranean influence shows up in the not-so-dainty tuna salad tossed with artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, black olives and capers.####['roasted red peppers', 'mediterranean influence', 'tuna salad']
(though the filet won't be enough if both have hearty apitites.####['apitites', 'filet']
the prices weren't bad though - dinner ended up at $80 with tip and we had a couple drinks as well.####['prices', 'dinner', 'tip']
impressive balcony seating and while they forgot to give us the cold appetizers, the waiter and maitre'd more than made up for it by being most accomodating to us.####['waiter', 'maitre', 'seating']
the clinton-frequented restaurant stands handsomely on a quiet residential corner, and the modern interior includes a long dining room, a small bar and harsh lighting.####['bar', 'interior']
the staff were rude and rushed us through our meal, clearing plates and laying down dessert menus while others were still eating their main courses.####['meal', 'main courses', 'staff', 'plates']
our waiter was a little stressed and brought a couple things out late and as a result, he apologized graciously and gave us wine on the house to compensate for the delay.####['waiter', 'wine']
my only advice is: increase portion sizes; and develop a special drink list.####['portion', 'drink list']
the scene neither trendy and slick nor haute and haughty, it this cozy wine bar adds a bit of mediterranean sun to the chilly east 70s.####['mediterranean', 'wine bar']

the fresh sliced mozzerella, the sweet roasted peppers, the hint of garlic and oil, are just some of the ingredients that produce the light otherworldly tasty pizza at grimaldi's.####['pizza', 'ingredients']
snack on a bowl of fried chickpeas while you browse the menu, then move onto the tender lamb skewers, which arrive atop a slab of french bread, perfectly poised to catch the meat's sweet drippings.####['meat', 'a bowl of fried chickpeas', 'lamb skewers', 'french bread', 'menu']
anyway we get a table and order some appetizers from one of the waitresses who was pleasently nice.####['appetizers', 'table', 'waitresses']
however, it takes ages to get seated (even with a reservation), and the waiters don't seem very knowledgeable about the menu (or receptive to questions).####['reservation', 'waiters']
the feta cheese wrapped in filo dough and deep fried is a must try appetizer.####['deep fried', 'appetizer', 'filo dough']
the hostess was totally not accomadating, and even though there were empty tables they still didn't seat us!####['seat', 'hostess']

the service was slow took ten mins to get me a glass of water.####['service', 'glass', 'water']
the server came by only once to pour additional wine for the table; the rest of the time, we had to fish the bottle out of the two-table communal bucket ourselves.####['bottle', 'fish', 'the table', 'server', 'wine']

1) service is very slow and unattentive (10 minutes for our server to come by with our menus and to take our drink order, another 10 to bring the drinks/take our dinner order, you get the idea.####['service', 'server', 'dinner', 'menus']
went with a girlfriend, waited for over an hour while we had drinks, food was ok, service was terrible.####['service', 'drinks']
the food the menu includes lovingly made renditions of panini, bruschetta and tramezzini (cocktail-style sandwiches with fillings like tuna with black olive pesto and bresaola with arugula), along with a roster of cured meats, cheeses and olives that have been imported from italy.####['tramezzini', 'bruschetta', 'menu']
very pleasant atmosphere, not a quiet romantic dinner.####['dinner', 'atmosphere']
met a friend here for lunch and while the food was excellent (i ordered the turkey sandwich with avocado and bacon), the service was rather unattentive -- though well meaning.####['turkey sandwich with avocado and bacon', 'food', 'lunch']
the pastisio platter especially because you get a good amount of salad that's dry as the sahara desert, three wedges of bland potatoes, and a thin slice of microwaved pastisio that was awful for $9.####['potatoes', 'salad', 'desert']
they also have a great deal of 2 cheese slices and a drink for $3.####['drink', '2 cheese slices']
the bill came out to like $100pp, and noone touched their food, and drinks were left untouched because after the first bite/sip you want to never touch it again.####['food', 'drinks', 'bill']
the place was so dark, i needed the table candle to read the menu and could not properly see what i was eating.####['place', 'table', 'menu']
i recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab.####['stir fry blue crab', 'jelly fish', 'drunken chicken', 'soupy dumplings']

sometimes i've just ordered arepas and empanadas for my meal; other times, i've split a dinner entree and an appetizer with a friend and been satisfied, since the portions are so huge.####['meal', 'dinner entree', 'portions', 'appetizer']
the space is grand with a very high ceiling although it is one of those places that they keep so dark you are not really sure what you are eating anyway.####['space', 'ceiling']

the prices are incredibly reasonable, especially considering the huge portions - by noodle soup could have fed both my husband and myself.####['portions', 'noodle soup']
about 10 of us came here for drinks last friday, the atmosphere was good for chatting and hanging out, but not enough lounge or bar space, they should open up the back area w/ more loungable chairs or booths if they want to catch any after dinner sort of bar crowd.####['dinner', 'bar crowd', 'lounge', 'drinks', 'atmosphere']
it's a small and quaint place so have your expectations in check, but that doesn't mean anything bad - know going in that you are gonna eat some serious food!####['food', 'place', 'check']
it was not the mistake of the frozen lasagna, it was the icy service of the manager which has spoiled this restaurant for me.####['service', 'frozen lasagna', 'manager']

i always listen to the waiters' recommendations, because they're always awesome - either a special or just one of their faves off the menu.####['waiters', 'menu']
not including the tip for our server, who we saw twice in an hour?####['server', 'tip']
get a pitcher of red or white sangria and choose from a large selection of tapas.####['white sangria', 'tapas']
aside from the fact the maitre de claimed the dining room was 'full', we were seated at a great table overlooking the lobby of the hotel and ordered the 5 course tasting menu.####['maitre', 'lobby', 'menu']
the only apparent flavor in any of the dishes was heat, and a table of four gourmands left at least half of our meals on our plates.####['meals', 'flavor', 'table']
miyagi is my sushi restaurant of choice in the village; it's never insanely crowded, the service is very sweet (i've never experienced any of the nastiness described in prior reviews), and the tabs are small.####['service', 'tabs']
my ceasar salad amounted to some limp lettuce and mayo strewn around a large plate, and the only way i might have died for the mac and cheese is due to natural causes while waiting for it to arrive.####['ceasar salad', 'lettuce', 'plate', 'mac and cheese']
and am content with a dinner of just the grilled tentacles and salad.####['salad', 'dinner']

i'd recommend getting an appetizer b/c the dinner takes a bit to be cooked, but it was definitely worth the wait.####['dinner', 'wait']
the waitress was no where to be found at all throughout the course of the meal, did not refill a single drink nor did she bother to inquire about my satisfaction with the food or even bring the check at the conclusion of the meal.####['waitress', 'food', 'single drink']
this restaurant was very  ask to the waiter or waitress to give you a table in the back room where all the romance of the place is situated with a so-called chimney!!####['waitress', 'back room']

the food was great so that made up for the lack of service from the waitress.####['service', 'food']
the defining characteristic of this popular restaurant, aside from dirt-cheap hot dogs, is the beverage selection, which includes a light and refreshing papaya juice, an extremely sweet pineapple juice and a sweet and frothy pina colada drink.####['drink', 'papaya juice', 'hot dogs', 'beverage selection']
