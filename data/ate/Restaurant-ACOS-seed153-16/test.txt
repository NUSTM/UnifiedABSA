rice is too dry , tuna was n ' t so fresh either .####['tuna', 'rice']
i have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent .####['fish']

the service ranges from mediocre to offensive .####['service']
on a recent trip , our waiter was extremely dismissive , while no less than three staff members waited hand - and - foot on a pair of japanese girls seated nearby .####['waiter', 'staff members']

they pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls .####['rolls', 'miso soup']

the outside patio area has an abbreviated menu .####['menu']

service was decent .####['service']
drinks were good .####['drinks']
excellent food , nice ambience , fairly expensive####['food', 'ambience']

– it is sad to see a place that was once ` ` the ' ' place to meet and eat for bfast or lunch , now be the place that is a big ` ` dont bother . ' '####['place']
the food is not what it once was ( potions have seriously seen downsizing ) prices have gone up , and the service is the worst i have experienced anywhere ( including mainland europe ) .####['service', 'food', 'the']
what may be interesting to most is the worst sevice / attitude comes from the owners of this establishment .####['owners']

the steak was done to my exact liking ( medium rare ) and was nice and juicy .####['steak']
it ? s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste .####['red wine reduction', 'peppercorn sauce']

but the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly .####['servers']

it ' s a great place to people watch .####['place']
late night dinning with exeptional food .####['food']
we were seated right away , the table was private and nice .####['table']
the service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters .####['service', 'waiters']
the food was very good , filet mignon was probably the best i ' ve ever try .####['food', 'filet mignon']
the portions are big though , so do not order too much .####['portions']
groovy music made the dinner casual .####['music']
i have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd .####['restroom']
the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .####['bathroom']
– mercedes restaurant is so tasty , the service is undeniably awesome !####['service']
the catering is out of this world , and raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world ! ! !####['catering', 'raouls chicken vegetable soup']
drinks are suberb , and i feel like i am in a third world country when i walk in the door .####['drinks']
the presentation of snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu .####['snooze', 'menu']
to start off , approximately 8 - 10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 .####['orange juice']
they serve it in a tall , skinny hour - glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .####['juice']
i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their menu was so unique that i continued .####['menu']
the pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8 . 50 for 3 - 6 ' ' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 ' ' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over - priced .####['pancakes']
the pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 ' ' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .####['pancakes']
on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if i had n ' t rejected the meal all together .####['eggs', 'meal']
i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue .####['dish']
in the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( i had water ) .####['breakfast burrito', 'iced tea', 'orange juice', 'pancakes']
much more than just a great view !####['view']
– i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray ' s boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations .####["ray ' s boathouse"]
ray ' s is something of a seattle institution , but given its gorgeous sound views , i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .####['sound views']
imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third - best thing about ray ' s !####['views', "ray ' s"]
to start things off , our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .####['brooke']
my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the shilshole sampler . . . a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , ray ' s fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .####['manila clams', 'soy dressing', 'white gulf prawns', 'butter sauce']
for my entr & eacute ; e , i completely enjoyed the seared alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano .####['seared alaskan sea scallops']
the scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique ( not to mention tasty ) .####['scallops']
my friend enjoyed the grilled alaskan king salmon with delectable creamed washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .####['grilled alaskan king salmon', 'green beans', 'creamed washington russet potatoes']
i had a taste of all three items on her plate , and they were superb .####['plate']
our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but i did remain puzzled by one issue : who thinks that ray ' s is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?####['server', "ray ' s"]
while i could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .####['food', 'server']
oh yeah . . . the view was good , too .####['view']
– i ca n ' t say enough about this place .####['place']
– i was highly disappointed in the food at pagoda .####['food']
finally a meal that you will remember for a long time !####['meal']
every time ` ` 0 - sixtynine ' ' is called the bartender buys everyone drinks !####['bartender']
unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks i would n ' t recommend going here .####['drinks']
it was romantic - and even nice even with my sister , reminded me of italy , and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a mediterrean villa .####['music', 'artwork']
i should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild .####['food']
lebanese food ! yum !####['lebanese food']
– i ' ve been to open sesame only once , but i ' m still reeling from the experience ! !####['open sesame']
we have since returned and also had a great experience , sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good ) .####['beer']
we did have the same waiter the second time , so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good .####['waiter']
sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun .####['band']
i hope one day scooner or later returns to what it once was .####['scooner or later']
– after 12 years in seattle ray ' s rates as the place we always go back to .####["ray ' s"]
a cozy spot for 2####['spot']
– i ca n ' t believe murphy ' s has been around for over 25 years , amazing .####["murphy ' s"]
well i guess it ' s hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff .####['staff']
seafood plus####['seafood']
we had a very hard time getting the waitress ' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .####['waitress']
as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 % discount on our bill .####['owner']
i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n ' t work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link .####['restaurant']
after sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she ' d be right with us .####['bar keep']
management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners .####['management', 'waitstaff']
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee . . . oh la la yummy ! ! !####['mango ginger creme brulee']
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant .####['restaurant']
i ' m astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ .####['restaurant']
in other words , if they are n ' t making $ $ off of you then you do n ' t rate high on their ' service scale ' .####['service']
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment - - to say we had been ` ` blown off ' ' would be an understatement .####['manager']
the manager continually interrupted with ` ` is there anything else i can do for you ? ` ` , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .####['manager']
you are with a hot date and he / she has an urge for sushi . . . then this might be the place .####['sushi']
we were only in seattle for one night and i ' m so glad we picked rays for dinner !####['rays']
the pizza ' s are light and scrumptious .####["pizza ' s"]
go with some friends , wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe , and enjoy more than your average breakfast .####['breakfast']
i do n ' t know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place .####['place']
sit in the balcony####['balcony']
although the service could be improved considering the money you put in .####['service']
our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times .####['server']
this place rocks ! !####['place']
the chips and salsa are so yummy , and the prices are fabulous .####['salsa', 'chips']
the atmosphere is aspiring , and the decor is festive and amazing . .####['decor', 'atmosphere']
- mediocre service / quality####['service']
to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .####['manager']
all considered , i have to say that ray ' s boathouse is deserving of its title as a seattle institution .####["ray ' s boathouse"]
