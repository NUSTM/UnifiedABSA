i have never been so disgusted by both food an service .####['food', 'service']
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .####['food']
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####['meal']
i book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .####['white organza tent', 'four course prix fix menu']
i completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date .####['casa la femme']

my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .####['dish']
the wife had the risotto which was amazing .####['risotto']
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .####['farro salad', 'mashed yukon potatoes']
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza####['east village pizza', 'margherita pizza']
the crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####['sauce', 'crust', 'cheese']
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate decor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city .####['decor', 'unmarked wooden doors', 'spot']
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .####['grilled black cod', 'grilled salmon dish']
the entrees were served with miso soup and rice .####['entrees']
for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .####['frozen black sesame mousse', 'matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake']
the meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .####['kimchi', 'service', 'sauces', 'meat', 'salad', 'meal']

a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it .####['pacifico']
our waitress was n ' t mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####['waitress']
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####['restaurant']
regardless , we ' ll be back and ca n ' t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .####['patio']
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####['server', 'appetizer']
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .####['chicken']
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n ' t say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .####['waitress']
cirspy crust margherita pizza####['margherita pizza']
i ' ll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .####['hummus', 'decor', 'grilled octopus', 'pita']
if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this place .####['place']
only complaint is the pricing - - i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .####['menu']
as bfc does n ' t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####['bfc', 'front of house staff']
i ' d be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !####['staff']
considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service .####['service']
maitre - d - ' ' eat and get out ' '####['maitre - d']
the four seasons restaurant is a great experience .####['the four seasons restaurant']
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at bark you do n ' t just get your average hot dog .####['bark', 'hot dog']
i highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .####['fish tacos']
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner .####['casa la femme']
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .####['waitress']
