a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it .####['pacifico']
our waitress was n ' t mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####['waitress']
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####['restaurant']
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####['server', 'appetizer']
i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms .####['salmon']
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n ' t say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .####['waitress']
so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it .####['spinach']
this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it ' s a matter of taste that she did n ' t like it , and i can not comp it .####['manager']
this staff should be fired .####['staff']
cirspy crust margherita pizza####['margherita pizza']
it was really good pizza .####['pizza']
if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this place .####['place']
only complaint is the pricing - - i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .####['menu']
fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n ' t put you off –####['food', 'front of house staff']
each time we ' ve been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they ' re fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .####['fish dishes', 'waiters', 'front of house staff']
as bfc does n ' t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####['bfc', 'front of house staff']
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening .####['calamari', 'mussles']
the four seasons restaurant is a great experience .####['the four seasons restaurant']
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at bark you do n ' t just get your average hot dog .####['bark', 'hot dog']
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner .####['casa la femme']
the food is very good , but not outstanding .####['food']
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .####['wait', 'staff']
but the service is horrid !####['service']
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .####['waitress']
