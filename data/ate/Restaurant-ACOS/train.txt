this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york .####['gyros']
what really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices , and all made in - house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .####['sausages', 'gyro meat', 'ingredients', 'food']

however , our main course was wonderful .####['main course']

the dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .####['pear torte', 'staff']
when we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .####['waitress']
all in all , i would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .####['restaurant', 'staff']
short and sweet – seating is great : it ' s romantic , cozy and private .####['seating']
the boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they ' re perfect for 2 people .####['boths']
the service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .####['waiter', 'service', 'service button']

the menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .####['waiter', 'menu', 'food']
nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that ' s when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .####['mushroom sauce']
i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .####['manager']
the manager finally said he would com # # p the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .####['manager']
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .####['food']
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .####['restaurant', 'customer service']

the chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( i have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the chilli chicken .####['chicken lollipop', 'dishes', 'chilli chicken']

what you are paying for is the environment and the name .####['environment']

i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .####['restaurant']
the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say ` ` i ' ve been to the four seasons restaurant ' ' .####['the four seasons']

if you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .####['food']
you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .####['service']

i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience !####['casa la femme']
i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .####['casa la femme']
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table .####['wait']
the place is beautiful !####['place']
the hostess was very pleasant .####['hostess']
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka .####['waiter']

i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .####['restaurant']

there was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .####['beer']
not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with brahma .####['selection of bottled beer']
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .####['fried oysters and clams']
the lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .####['lobster knuckles']
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the ` ` salt encrusted shrimp ' ' appetizer .####["` ` salt encrusted shrimp ' ' appetizer"]
i had the thai style fried sea bass . . . which was very good .####['thai style fried sea bass']
everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice !####['food', 'grilled mahi mahi']
i heard the lobster roll was excellent .####['lobster roll']
all in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh .####['food']
service not the friendliest to our ` ` large party ' ' !####['service']
great indian food####['indian food']
food was amazing - i love indian food and eat it quite regularly , but i can say this is one of the best i ' ve had .####['food']
very ` ` normal indian food ' ' , but done really well .####['indian food']
also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .####['waiters']

i have never been so disgusted by both food an service .####['service', 'food']
however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it ' s your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####['kimchee', 'korean fair']
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .####['food']
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####['meal']
it was n ' t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it ' s simply repulsive .####['restaurant']

i completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date .####['casa la femme']
the bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n ' t even close to sizzling .####['bibimbap', 'stone bowl']
too bad i had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .####['stone bowl']
the nakgi - bokum was horrible .####['nakgi - bokum']
easily the worst stir - fried squid i ' ve ever tasted .####['stir - fried squid']
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean .####['sauce']
the side dishes were passable , and i did get a refill upon request .####['side dishes']
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service .####['service']
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .####['dish']
the wife had the risotto which was amazing .####['risotto']
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .####['mashed yukon potatoes', 'farro salad']
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza####['east village pizza', 'margherita pizza']
love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go .####['place']
a quintessential slice of nyc pizza .####['slice of nyc pizza']
the crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####['cheese', 'sauce', 'crust']
personally i like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .####['margherita pizza']
possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city####['restaurant']
this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie ( that don ’ t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !####['modern japanese brasserie']
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate decor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city .####['spot', 'unmarked wooden doors', 'decor']
if you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .####['glass ceilings', 'private booths']
it ’ s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘ excuse me ’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth !####['waiter']
my party had the bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !####['bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu']
we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .####['sashimi amuse bouche']
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .####['grilled black cod', 'grilled salmon dish']
the entrees were served with miso soup and rice .####['entrees']
for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .####['matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake', 'frozen black sesame mousse']
i do n ' t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i ' ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .####['zenkichi']
the service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .####['service']
they are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !####['pita bread', 'service', 'drinks']
great shabu shabu####['shabu shabu']
but for the shabu shabu , you wo n ' t find much better in ny .####['shabu shabu']
the meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .####['meat', 'salad', 'service', 'kimchi', 'sauces', 'meal']
dokebi gives williamsburg the right one - two punch of classic korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .####['fusion twists', 'pork belly tacos', 'korean food']
the hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .####['bun', 'hot dogs', 'pork croquette sandwich']
restaurant with a view####['view']
the food tasted very good .####['food']
the main entree was also very good .####['main entree']
price is high but the food is good , so i would come back again .####['food']
this place does n ' t make any sense####['place']
this place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional . . .####['mirrored walls', 'decor']
this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .####['place', 'food']
the concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n ' t work .####['japanese tapas']
good food####['food']
the food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , i do n ' t like being cramp in a corner .####['sitting space', 'food']
over all it was a very nice romantic place .####['place']
a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it .####['pacifico']
the atmosphere was great .####['atmosphere']
the food we ordered was excellent , although i would n ' t say the margaritas were anything to write home about .####['food', 'margaritas']
our waitress was n ' t mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####['waitress']
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####['restaurant']
regardless , we ' ll be back and ca n ' t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .####['patio']
the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .####['servers']
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####['server', 'appetizer']
overall the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n ' t sat cooling in front of the guest .####['food']
the place has a nice fit - out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins )####['furnishings', 'fit - out', 'wine list']
how is this palce still open ?####['palce']
everything was going good until we got our meals .####['meals']
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .####['chicken']
it was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .####['spinach']
i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms .####['salmon']
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n ' t say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .####['waitress']
so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it .####['spinach']
this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it ' s a matter of taste that she did n ' t like it , and i can not comp it .####['manager']
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .####['manager', 'appetizers', 'drinks']
this staff should be fired .####['staff']
cirspy crust margherita pizza####['margherita pizza']
it was really good pizza .####['pizza']
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded : ) : ) : )####['pizza', 'crust']
i ' ll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .####['grilled octopus', 'pita', 'decor', 'hummus']
if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this place .####['place']
this place . . . god where do i begin .####['place']
the decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n ' t notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 frickin hours to come ! ! ! !####['eggplant', 'decor']
great hot dogs !####['hot dogs']
the hot dogs are top notch , and they ' re slamwich is amazing !####['slamwich', 'hot dogs']
going to bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !####['bark']
only complaint is the pricing - - i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .####['menu']
fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n ' t put you off –####['food', 'front of house staff']
each time we ' ve been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they ' re fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .####['waiters', 'fish dishes', 'front of house staff']
as bfc does n ' t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####['bfc', 'front of house staff']
the frizzy retro girl ( with winged / dame edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .####['girl']
i ' d be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !####['staff']
there ' s another girl who i ca n ' t describe , she is about 5 ' 6 ' ' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you ' re * really * talking about .####['girl']
considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service .####['service']
maitre - d - ' ' eat and get out ' '####['maitre - d']
while finishing our meals which included a high - end bottle of wine , our son ' s fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .####['bottle of wine']
this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .####['frontman']
best meal in a long time !####['meal']
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening .####['calamari', 'mussles']
my father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish .####['flank steak']
the four seasons restaurant is a great experience .####['the four seasons restaurant']
the food is great and the environment is even better .####['environment', 'food']
taking hot dogs to the next level####['hot dogs']
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at bark you do n ' t just get your average hot dog .####['hot dog', 'bark']
here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .####['hot dog']
great atmosphere####['atmosphere']
i highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .####['fish tacos']
cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .####['fire place', 'atmosphere']
poor service and management####['service', 'management']
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner .####['casa la femme']
the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .####['manager']
can ’ t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .####['restaurant']
the food is very good , but not outstanding .####['food']
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .####['wait', 'staff']
mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine . . . but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff .####['staff']
the pasta was well cooked , did n ' t have enough sauce though or flavor .####['pasta']
the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .####['hostess']
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .####['bartender']
i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane .####['waitress']
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , ` ` can i help you ' ' and ` ` how many are in your party . ' '####['waitress']
bad staff####['staff']
i generally like this place .####['place']
the design of the space is good .####['space']
but the service is horrid !####['service']
i was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .####['waiter', 'waitress']
the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .####['waiter']
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .####['waitress']
i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would retrain the staff .####['place', 'staff']
