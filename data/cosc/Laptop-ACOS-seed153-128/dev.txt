the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####('cpu operation performance', 'negative')

now i ' m just down to some gripes that are probably here to stay : the bluetooth on this thing is really fussy , the non - functional video output ( using usb - c video out through an hdmi cable sends just a blank desktop background and no audio , even if i am playing a movie or youtube visibly on the c302 screen ) , and that it can ' t hold a vpn connection without dropping it every 20 - 30 minutes .####('laptop connectivity', 'negative')
