the keyboard was a bonus for me : i really like having the number pad for when working with spreadsheets and such , and this size laptop doesn ' t always have one .####('keyboard usability', 'positive')
additionally , this has a nice backlight to the keyboard , which will turn off when nothing has been pressed for about 20 seconds ( great for when just watching or reading something ) or can be manually turned off entirely .####('keyboard usability', 'positive')

i am terribly disappointed with obviously a poor qc by samsung .####('company quality', 'negative')
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .####('display operation performance', 'negative')
returning it into a standard laptop position did not help , the screen actually turned dark and only closing and opening the lid helped return it to normal state .####('display operation performance', 'negative')
to make things worse , i currently live overseas and am highly doubtful that samsung would do anything about this , given that it was bought in the us .####('support operation performance', 'negative')
no matter where on earth , you can get your apple product repaired .####('support general', 'positive')
in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this product given the obvious history of quality control issues .####('laptop quality', 'negative')
wanting something maybe a pinch faster , but more importantly , a flippy touchscreen with google play support .####('display operation performance', 'positive')
first and foremost , lets talk about the infamous keyboard .####('keyboard general', 'negative')
yes , it ' s absolute garbage .####('keyboard general', 'negative')
i ' m surprised people are settling for claiming ` ` it ' s good enough ` ` or ` ` gets the job done ` ` when every time i use it , i ' m constantly reminded of how i should have just sprang for the pixelbook when it was on sale for $ 699 .####('laptop price', 'negative')
i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of keyboards and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .####('keyboard general', 'negative')
my 2nd issues is with it ' s performance .####('laptop operation performance', 'negative')
even in the early rounds the frames are heavily compromised and the entire game feels very sluggish .####('software operation performance', 'negative')
i ' ll give the chromebook pro an extra star for its best asset , the screen .####('display general', 'positive')
it does indeed look excellent !####('display design features', 'positive')
it ' s also worth noting my unit came with a floating trackpad , with initial play before the actually click .####('display operation performance', 'negative')
if you are indifferent about the screen , do not buy this !####('laptop general', 'positive')
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####('laptop operation performance', 'negative')
there is a power button on the side which i have accidentally hit quite a few times .####('keyboard design features', 'negative')
i haven ' t abused this at all , and i noticed a small crack in the screen today and it ' s starting to spider out .####('display quality', 'negative')
so $ 500 bucks down the drain as i ' m sure that isn ' t covered by any warranties .####('warranty quality', 'negative')
with it being a touch screen it surprised me that it cracked and i have no idea how .####('display operation performance', 'negative')
my screen stayed black more than it was on .####('display operation performance', 'negative')

after a couple of weeks i started experiencing web browsing issues .####('software operation performance', 'negative')
first occasionally and later to a point where the laptop became unusable .####('laptop operation performance', 'negative')
after some googling i realized that the wifi issue was related to bluetooth being on .####('ports operation performance', 'negative')
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####('hardware operation performance', 'negative')
10 minutes after finishing this review started having a new issue : touch pad started acting out .####('hardware operation performance', 'negative')
you know , i wanted to love this machine .####('laptop general', 'neutral')
i went in to this purchase assuming that the availability of android apps from the google play store would make this unit into a true windows alternative .####('software usability', 'negative')
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .####('keyboard operation performance', 'negative')
' what a bunch of whiners , ' i concluded about all the people who slammed the keyboard .####('keyboard general', 'negative')
so one star off for the keyboard .####('keyboard general', 'negative')
needless to say , if you thought this capability would allow you to use a browser other than chrome , forget it .####('os operation performance', 'negative')
none of their android versions were what i would call usable .####('software usability', 'negative')
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .####('display general', 'positive')
if you want to spend 5 or 6 hundred bucks for that , rock on .####('laptop price', 'negative')
unfortunately , my chromebook that i purchased through best buy was dead on arrival .####('laptop general', 'negative')
the problem is that it never charged .####('laptop operation performance', 'negative')

apparently there is some optimizations that google has done with the op1 and pixel that allow what is called instant ink .####('company operation performance', 'positive')

there were challenges with the chromebook specific apps and the google play store apps worked sometimes , but most of them had the size issue where they are only the size of a phone screen .####('software design features', 'negative')
reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .####('laptop quality', 'negative')

also the case design is sort of rounded at both sides - a minor issue but it makes the device pop open in my purse and detracts from the ` ` feel ` ` of the device by making it feel a lot thicker than it actually is .####('hardware design features', 'negative')

no caps lock on the keyboard .####('keyboard design features', 'negative')
virtually every single app for it is compromised in some manner .####('software operation performance', 'negative')

chrome os is not matured in any way .####('laptop general', 'negative')
it calls itself a computer , but it ' s really not .####('laptop general', 'negative')
it fancies itself a convertible notebook / app consuming functional tablet , but it is not .####('laptop general', 'negative')
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####('os usability', 'negative')
google is very concerned about arc to chromeos connections for security , etc etc .####('company general', 'neutral')
the rub is that chromeos itself is so limited in functionality that it is probably the most secure os platform out there .####('os general', 'negative')
apps are glitchy .####('software usability', 'negative')
samsung sent me a new stylus free of charge and free of hassle , which was nice of them because the top of the oem stylus popped off one day and could not be reassembled .####('hardware general', 'positive')

certain apps ( especially flash based apps ) will get the machine very hot .####('software operation performance', 'negative')
the bottom plastic piece - this is not a unibody machine - will be too hot to rest on bare skin .####('hardware design features', 'negative')
i can not explain why , except to think that there is something wrong with the voltage wiring and the left channel is exceeding design capacity .####('ports operation performance', 'negative')
the left charging port does not always make full contact with the charger and so sometimes the usb c charger is plugged in and slightly awry and therefore not charging .####('ports operation performance', 'negative')
the touchpad doesn ' t have clickable function in the top right or top left corners which is becomes annoying for certain tasks .####('hardware design features', 'negative')
many of acer ' s chromebooks have , historically , been hampered by their poor displays .####('display general', 'negative')
the chromebook 14 has a 1080p ips display with fantastic viewing angles and excellent brightness .####('display design features', 'positive')
i keep it at about 60 - 70 % and it looks fantastic .####('display operation performance', 'positive')
it feels wonderful to finally say that about an acer display .####('display design features', 'positive')
a more recent trend among chrome os devices is the inclusion of 4gb of ram and 32gb of storage , instead of the 2gb / 16gb to which we ' ve become accustomed .####('memory operation performance', 'neutral')
the extra ram , however , is great for everyone , as it makes this device more capable of running many tabs , or handling higher demand tasks like streaming content , without tabs crashing out or caching / reloading .####('memory operation performance', 'positive')
the screen is great , for both media consumption and general computing / web browsing ; it offers a nice amount of local storage and solid performance via the intel processor and 4gb of ram , and it looks sharp , thanks to modern design queues and aluminum build materials .####('memory operation performance', 'positive')

the acer is very nice , to be sure , especially considering the price or $ 299 .####('laptop price', 'positive')
it also has pretty decent i / o with two usb 3 .####('ports connectivity', 'positive')
i can ' t help but feel that people are also slightly exaggerating the performance offered by the n3160 .####('cpu operation performance', 'negative')
it is solid , and does a decent job rendering pages , and paired with the extra ram here , it adequately handles streaming content in the background - such as youtube or spotify - and still maintains a decent browsing experience across eight to ten additional tabs ;####('laptop operation performance', 'positive')
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####('laptop general', 'positive')
i led with those first five points for a reason : being able to purchase a decently - performing chromebook with aluminum build , a 1080p ips display , 4gb of ram , 32gb of local storage , and an intel quad - core processor for $ 299 is basically what the entirely of the chromeos subreddit has been asking for over the past few years .####('laptop miscellaneous', 'positive')
5 years old or matched by chromebooks at half the price , the absence of a touchscreen upgrade , or the use of slower emmc storage instead of a real m .####('memory operation performance', 'negative')
these are all valid points that probably make this more of a 4 .####('laptop general', 'positive')
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .####('company general', 'positive')
even the touchpad and keyboard perform as well as the very best chromebooks currently available .####('keyboard operation performance', 'positive')
anything that runs in a chrome browser on a desktop or laptop will run on a chromebook , and there are novel app - like extensions for almost anything else ( calculator apps , command lines , etc . )####('laptop usability', 'positive')

for students and road warriors , the extended battery life and automatic cloud integration makes sync - ing a breeze , especially if you hotspot from your phone .####('battery operation performance', 'positive')
from the camera and audio quality through to the build styling , every aspect of this pc has been meticulously considered and it represents the best chromebook that has been delivered to date####('laptop general', 'positive')

thus far , i am very happy with the purchase , and highly recommend it .####('laptop general', 'positive')
i think biggest reason i like it is that it ' s sturdy and i don ' t mind throwing it in and out of my backpack whereas with a $ 1000 mb air i might be a whole lot more careful in how i handle it .####('laptop quality', 'positive')
hope to continue to get many more years of use out of it !####('laptop general', 'positive')

this is one of the best purchases i have made in years .####('laptop general', 'positive')
since i already do all of my work in google drive , this is perfect for me .####('laptop general', 'positive')
it ' s the best solution i ' ve used for collaborating on a budget .####('laptop price', 'positive')
however , know what you ' re buying before you get a chromebook : it operates on a chrome operating system and you can ' t install apps or games on it like world of warcraft .####('laptop usability', 'neutral')
screen quality is perfect and matte so no annoying glare !####('display quality', 'positive')
the keys on the keyboard are sunk in a little too low to accommodate for the sleek / thin profile .####('keyboard design features', 'negative')
it take a bit of getting used to .####('keyboard usability', 'neutral')

it is a steal at $ 179 and worth a 5 star rating for the previous reasons .####('laptop price', 'positive')
as other reviews have mentioned - its a bit heavier than expected for such a slim frame .####('laptop design features', 'negative')
overall , i ' m definitely satisfied , i bought it wanting a well built laptop on the larger end ( which is why i ultimately went with the 14 inch ) with a solid material / frame .####('laptop general', 'positive')

it on the developer channel and have full access to the play store .####('laptop usability', 'positive')

more importantly i appreciate the uncanny speed to boot up or wake up .####('os operation performance', 'positive')
never has it run out of power while on battery .####('battery operation performance', 'positive')

however , having been out of school for several years now , the viability of purchasing a mac ( particularly as they are increasing in price ) no longer seems viable .####('laptop price', 'negative')
first of all , the battery life on it is insane .####('battery operation performance', 'positive')
first , it is hard to run more than 10 tabs open at any given time .####('laptop operation performance', 'negative')

losing the function keys for a toucher was a deal breaker .####('keyboard design features', 'negative')
the base model went up in price $ 400 , which excludes any performance benefits .####('laptop price', 'negative')
the only real upgrade for the new one , before adding on options is faster memory .####('memory operation performance', 'positive')
i run windows and linux vms fairly regularly and while i could run them on a comparable windows system , adding windows systems to an already portly windows system has never worked out well for me , so while disappointed in the new upgrades , this 2015 model still rocks vms and does all i need it too for far less $ $ $ .####('software usability', 'negative')
while usb - c is cool , a bag full of dongles is not .####('ports general', 'positive')

with the recent apple upgrade to macbook pros ( the touch of genius bar or whatever ) , the price has jumped .####('laptop price', 'neutral')

when the computer is working hard , it doesn ' t burn my lap anymore ( although i do feel some hot air flowing through my fingertips , when i am typing , but i am okay with that ) .####('fans&cooling general', 'positive')
the plug keeps unplugging .####('power supply general', 'negative')

now audio in and out are combined in just one port .####('ports design features', 'negative')
i don ' t like this .####('ports general', 'negative')
it ' s very expensive for such a simple device .####('multimedia devices price', 'negative')
- the screen is harder to clean .####('display design features', 'negative')

the current model only has two , which can be problematic if you hook up an external hard drive and an external bluray drive ( which requires two ports ) at the same time .####('laptop design features', 'negative')
sure , another generation back was arguably better , but i find this computer to be adequate to my needs right now ( though it is a disappointment that i can ' t upgrade the ram , which definitely limits the lifetime of how long this product will last ) .####('laptop general', 'neutral')

and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .####('os usability', 'positive')

i ' m probably a bit biased on macs since i ' m a professional graphic designer , and it ' s just the industry standard .####('laptop general', 'neutral')

i think the mbp ticks off more of the nice - to - have boxes for me than the xps13 overall .####('laptop design features', 'positive')
the mbp does not run as hot as my old white mb did .####('laptop quality', 'neutral')
the battery life is really pretty comparable ( slightly more with the mbp , and i can obtain info on app energy usage a bit easier imo ) .####('battery general', 'positive')
the trackpad is the ultimate difference - maker for me .####('keyboard general', 'neutral')
the mbp trackpad is best in class and if you are not using a mouse , this makes a huge difference .####('keyboard general', 'positive')
the mbp 13 ` ` is plenty mobile .####('laptop portability', 'positive')
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####('software operation performance', 'negative')

adobe apps are also power hogs , but that is to be expected .####('software operation performance', 'neutral')
i also feel like apple hides too much under the hood from the user , but i suppose you can still work around that if you are so inclined .####('company general', 'neutral')
an unexpected benefit for me has been the iphone / mbp integration .####('laptop design features', 'positive')
i love the airdrop and receiving imessages on my mbp ( although it can cut into productivity if you ' re not careful ) .####('software operation performance', 'positive')

it ' ll be interesting to see what the revisions are in 2016 , but i was worried about the shallow keys of the new macbook making their way to the mbp and the loss of port options with a new revision , so i am very happy to have this now .####('laptop general', 'positive')

i predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 ( frostbyte 3 engine ) that this machine will perform well with the impending starwars battlefront ( also frostbyte 3 ) .####('laptop operation performance', 'positive')

the machine is easy to use , snappy , and everything the reviewers say .####('laptop usability', 'positive')
the main bad for this particular variant is that google is no longer going to support it with updates .####('support general', 'negative')
so be forwarded , if you buy this , you are jumping right into a machine that won ' t get updates anymore ( which is something most chromebook owners want and a feature that makes them better than android and it ' s fragmented market ) .####('laptop general', 'negative')

it takes up more than 1 / 3rd of the palm - area horizontal space and makes thumb - tapping mouse tweaks very easy .####('display design features', 'positive')
finally , there are the ports .####('ports general', 'negative')
- beautiful , bright ips screen with full 1080p resolution####('display design features', 'positive')
- backlit keyboard rocks####('keyboard design features', 'positive')
- battery life is pretty amazing at 10 - 11hrs####('battery operation performance', 'positive')
- 4gb ram cap .####('memory operation performance', 'neutral')
- many ui elements are not user - friendly in tablet mode####('os operation performance', 'negative')
- port minimalism .####('ports portability', 'negative')
out of the box , the asus c302ca is a powerhouse for stock chromeos usage .####('laptop general', 'positive')
performance - wise , i can easily have 12 - 24 tabs open simultaneously and see no slow - down in performance .####('os operation performance', 'positive')
one place that i find lacking in chromeos is the settings management .####('os design features', 'negative')
for the most - part you don ' t have much freedom to make any significant changes to settings .####('software design features', 'negative')
- clean and secure operating system that is very lean and gets the most out of the systems modest specs####('os design features', 'positive')
- with the combination of web - based productivity tools and development apps / services , this chromebook can provide a breadth of very viable usage scenarios without bogging the system down with locally install applications .####('laptop operation performance', 'positive')
- android apps and google play store are real game changers for the chromeos landscape .####('software general', 'positive')
- boot time , sleep time and wake time are crazy fast .####('os quality', 'positive')
- system settings could be more robust and better organized####('os design features', 'neutral')
- tablet - mode still needs some work .####('laptop operation performance', 'negative')
so , this is where this little chromebook really shines .####('laptop general', 'positive')
apps start very fast , graphics are much more responsive and capable when not being shared with chromeos and there are a number of ways you can tweak the ui / ux to your own liking .####('graphics usability', 'positive')
all that being said , you get a lot of bang for the buck with these three enhanced desktop / application options and i use all three in some capacity every day , so don ' t think your ' e isolated to just one approach .####('software general', 'positive')
while the stock aluminum case is darn solid enough , it can take scratches easily from things like keys or cable connectors tossed in a bag with it .####('laptop quality', 'positive')
d ) a bluetooth mouse - while this unarguably has one of the best trackpads in chromebook land , there are still times you just need the precision of a mouse .####('hardware general', 'positive')
0 type - a low - profile memory stick on a usb - c adaptor , but that would be silly .####('ports general', 'negative')
it was an excellent machine for the money and it also got me spoiled with its touch screen .####('display operation performance', 'positive')

while the chromebook pro does have a nice high - resolution 3 : 2 screen and the s - pen ( which is truly a gimmick anyway ) , it has half the storage , shorter battery life , and no backlit keyboard .####('memory design features', 'negative')

the brightness and clarity are awesome .####('display operation performance', 'positive')
this is quality hardware , and it shows .####('hardware quality', 'positive')
it ' s complementary , not revolutionary , which is much more intuitive and useful .####('laptop general', 'positive')
again , this is where the build quality really shines .####('laptop quality', 'positive')
the microsd slot leaves an inserted card perfectly flush .####('ports operation performance', 'positive')
this flip 2 really is a fantastic chromebook , and the ability to run android apps only makes it better !####('software operation performance', 'positive')

it runs most of those apps and games beautifully and when combined with a ` ` logitech gamepad f310 ` ` you can play the games with a game controller !####('software operation performance', 'positive')
overall this is a home run purchase and i can ' t say enough good things about the asus c302 .####('laptop general', 'positive')
i mostly use it for playing a couple of games , surfing the web , managing my calendar / tasks lists , reading e - books , that sort of thing .####('laptop operation performance', 'neutral')
the keyboard is small , a little weird and takes some getting used to .####('keyboard design features', 'negative')

it ' s light , but also has a good weight to it .####('laptop design features', 'positive')
- the touchscreen is very responsive , fast , and so far everything has scaled just fine during use####('hardware operation performance', 'positive')
- the hinges are just perfect .####('hardware general', 'positive')
- the speakers are to the sides and not underneath so the sound isn ' t muffled when it ' s resting on something other than a flat surface####('multimedia devices design features', 'positive')
- this chromebook has access to the android beta channel for android apps####('laptop design features', 'neutral')
and because of the constant usage of higher brightness , the battery does drain faster .####('battery operation performance', 'negative')
they both pick up oils and such pretty easily .####('display operation performance', 'negative')
as for the asus , it is a wonderful laptop .####('laptop general', 'positive')
i have had no issues with the track pad ; it works fine .####('keyboard operation performance', 'positive')
i have not fully tested battery life but it seems to last about as long as advertised .####('battery operation performance', 'positive')
one , the display is gorgeous ; watching video is a treat .####('display operation performance', 'positive')
however , there is screen glare , even in a normally lit room , not just a brightly lit room .####('display operation performance', 'negative')
i think that the bezels are a smidge thick , but that actually makes perfect sense .####('hardware design features', 'positive')
it ' s a real treat .####('laptop general', 'positive')
my use experience has been riddled with lag and jitteriness , although using the touchscreen for a moment sorts everything out .####('hardware operation performance', 'positive')

the core m3 allows this system to get fast and to stay quiet .####('cpu operation performance', 'positive')
sometimes , under heavy loads , the bottom of the c302 gets warm to the touch , but not to the point of pain .####('fans&cooling quality', 'neutral')
all the while , it provides one of the fastest web browsing experiences that i ' ve ever experienced .####('software operation performance', 'positive')
it will take years of bad programming to make this chromebook as slow as my last one got .####('laptop operation performance', 'negative')
2 ) the touchpad is way too wonky - asus needs to fix this asap .####('hardware operation performance', 'negative')
having had it for just over a month , i have to say i am thoroughly impressed by its versatility and how stable the os is .####('os operation performance', 'positive')
on a side note , there is a slight defect on my chromebook as there is some creaking and loose feeling when pressing on the bottom left side of my screen , this can be especially annoying in tablet mode .####('laptop quality', 'negative')
