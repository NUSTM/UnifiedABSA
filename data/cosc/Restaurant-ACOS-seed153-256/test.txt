on weekends , you might have to wait for couple hours .####('service general', 'neutral')
however , they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone .####('service general', 'positive')

well i guess it ' s hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff .####('service general', 'negative')
once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal .####('service general', 'negative')
the prior reviews said kid friendly . . . give me a break with two young children that is light years .####('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')

never had one single problem there .####('restaurant general', 'positive')
seafood plus####('food quality', 'positive')

if you ' re going to see danny gans or just staying at the mirage , do n ' t miss this one .####('restaurant general', 'positive')
completely over rated !####('restaurant general', 'negative')
even then , the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items .####('service general', 'negative')
we had a very hard time getting the waitress ' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .####('service general', 'negative')
as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 % discount on our bill .####('service general', 'negative')
when the bill came , he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks .####('service general', 'negative')
it was clear he didn ’ t really care .####('service general', 'negative')
– save yourself the waste of time & do not visit .####('restaurant general', 'negative')
after sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes i left .####('service general', 'negative')
i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n ' t work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link .####('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')
i never heard back from anyone more than a month ago .####('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')
after sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she ' d be right with us .####('service general', 'negative')
as of writing this i just tried their give away a link again & it still does n ' t work .####('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')
always a winner .####('restaurant general', 'positive')
she does n ' t make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance .####('service general', 'negative')
but she is very friendly with certain people , making it even more annoying .####('service general', 'negative')
management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners .####('service general', 'negative')
they have been featured on the food network and they deserve it .####('restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive')
does n ' t get any better than that .####('restaurant general', 'positive')
you can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing .####('ambience general', 'positive')
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up .####('ambience general', 'positive')
first off , the food came fast and all together : ) i like that . . . i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other .####('service general', 'positive')
yummy .####('food quality', 'positive')
not chewy at all .####('food quality', 'positive')
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee . . . oh la la yummy ! ! !####('food quality', 'positive')
melt in your mouth .####('food quality', 'positive')
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant .####('restaurant general', 'positive')
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel . . . but they are definitely one you dont want to miss , esp if your in downtown san jose .####('restaurant general', 'positive')
we easily spent more than $ 40 per person ( not including alcohol ) and were still hungry .####('restaurant prices', 'negative')

i ' m astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ .####('restaurant prices', 'negative')
we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it ' d be a 30 minute wait .####('service general', 'negative')
we went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago ! !####('service general', 'negative')
none that i can think of .####('restaurant general', 'negative')
we put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n ' t arrive until 45 minutes later . . . with our main course .####('service general', 'negative')
um so now what are appetizers for ? ? ?####('service general', 'negative')
oh i forgot to mention that they do n ' t have bread service .####('service general', 'negative')
my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water ( she had a sore throat ) and i guess that since it was only water , it was n ' t a priority for them to actually bring it .####('service general', 'negative')
in other words , if they are n ' t making $ $ off of you then you do n ' t rate high on their ' service scale ' .####('service general', 'negative')
its great if you spent the day there and did n ' t want to drive to eat .####('location general', 'positive')
parking is reasonably good , they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby .####('restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive')
always good .####('restaurant general', 'positive')
6pm on a sat before a broadway play and we were quickly seated and served .####('service general', 'positive')
as part of a small party of four , our food was dropped off without comment ;####('service general', 'negative')
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table .####('service general', 'negative')
when we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order .####('service general', 'negative')
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment - - to say we had been ` ` blown off ' ' would be an understatement .####('service general', 'negative')
the manager continually interrupted with ` ` is there anything else i can do for you ? ` ` , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .####('service general', 'negative')
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n ' t bothered to get the waitresses name .####('service general', 'negative')
in short , schooner or later could n ' t have cared less about our being at their establishment .####('service general', 'negative')
you are with a hot date and he / she has an urge for sushi . . . then this might be the place .####('food quality', 'positive')

you ca n ' t go wrong here .####('restaurant general', 'positive')
seriously , you ca n ' t go wrong , if it is unpretentious local fun you seek .####('ambience general', 'positive')
my mouth felt very dry afterwards and i had that signature ? msg ? taste lingering in my throat after i left the restaurant .####('food quality', 'negative')
they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and not - too - sweet .####('food quality', 'positive')
the dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip , almost $ 50 / pp after tax and tip ( about average ) .####('service general', 'positive')

waited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd .####('service general', 'neutral')
not sure if i would go back .####('restaurant general', 'negative')
in fact , many want to return a second time during their visit .####('restaurant general', 'positive')
they are n ' t the most talkative , but everytime i ' ve been there they have been very busy , which probably accounts for the lack of conversation .####('service general', 'neutral')
it ' s just the right size for the menu .####('restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive')
excellent####('restaurant general', 'positive')
you never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there .####('food quality', 'positive')
the pizza ' s are light and scrumptious .####('food quality', 'positive')

the most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places .####('restaurant prices', 'positive')
i felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom .####('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')

to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .####('service general', 'negative')

two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner . . . they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table .####('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')
all considered , i have to say that ray ' s boathouse is deserving of its title as a seattle institution .####('restaurant general', 'positive')
