the unit cost $ 275 to start with , so it is not worth repairing .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
going from acer 15 to acer 11 was difficult , 11 inches seems too small for me .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
also it ' s not a true ssd drive in there but emmc , which makes a difference .####[('hard disc', 'negative')]
the computer has difficulty switching between tablet and computer .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
2 / 28 / 18 - a couple days ago i updated the chrome os .####[('os', 'neutral')]
it ' s just that chrome doesn ' t work the same with a chromebook as it does with windows .####[('os', 'negative')]
hopefully in 10 years they ' ll have this figured out and it won ' t suck so badly .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
bought this last year on july .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
i rarely use the keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
- great price for a touchscreen chromebook####[('laptop', 'positive')]
it is glitchy , and barely usable .####[('hardware', 'negative')]
i ordered one , the touch pad failed to work consistently .####[('hardware', 'negative')]
i often find i ' ve typed an entire sentence ( or more ) with my fingers on the wrong keys , which is very unproductive when trying to take real - time notes in a meeting !####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
i know it only takes a few seconds , but a new device should not be doing this and makes me question if it ' ll get worse in the future .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
i also have to press the trackpad very hard for left click ( not as badly as the first unit , though ) , and i lost right click functionality on the track pad 2 days into my voyage with this thing .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
i tried factory resetting after i updated the os , and it still drained 9 % over 8 hours .####[('os', 'neutral')]
hdmi out doesn ' t work right .####[('ports', 'negative')]
they had it over a week and then shipped back .####[('support', 'neutral')]
i was excited to receive this chromebook , only to watch that excitement dissipate within mere hours as i noticed the touchscreen did n ' t work at all on tablet mode .####[('hardware', 'negative')]
clearly there is some kind of major defect here that acer has n ' t resolved .####[('company', 'negative')]
i bought this for my daughter to use to take online classes while she ' s overseas in europe for a year .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
decent sound quality .####[('multimedia devices', 'positive')]
flimsy power adapter .####[('power supply', 'negative')]
wi - fi slows down to crowl and speeds back up intermittently .####[('ports', 'negative')]
regret buying it at times .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
it just turned off and will not turn back on .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
the product is great , but the customer support is horrible .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('support', 'negative')]
called support a second time after 10 minutes of verifying some type of info they told me to call google without even trying to help .####[('support', 'negative')]
but i ' m getting into photography now , and it ' s terrible for loading , storing , and editing pictures .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
i have sent it in twice already and waiting for it to come back .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
the screen looked great .####[('display', 'positive')]
no matter how many times i reinserted the charging adapter , i kept getting this message .####[('power supply', 'negative')]
i had no option but to shut down the computer , unplug it , plug it back in , and then reboot .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
it has worked well except for an initial hiccup on turning it on .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the screen flashes for a second every 30 seconds or so .####[('display', 'negative')]
i noticed the battery went down to 67 % for no reason .####[('battery', 'negative')]
works good but the fan kicks in pretty often , which is to keep the laptop cool but the sound is annoying .####[('fans&cooling', 'negative')]
nano edge display is nice .####[('display', 'positive')]
everything was fine and i went out for an hour .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the audio is almost impossible to hear .####[('multimedia devices', 'negative')]
it is slow to do everything .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
here ' s the kicker : it is doing a terrible job running dragon age .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
it doesn ' t has backlit keyboard : ( typing in low light is such a pain .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
very disappointed in how slow it seems .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
keyboard and mouse pad seem fine , but overall it seems strangely slow .####[('laptop', 'negative'), ('keyboard', 'positive')]
i have been using this for just 3 months .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
crazy keypad : this issue is even worse .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
overall , the laptop has a solid feel to it .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this lead me to believe that although i purchased a “ new ” product , they sent me a refurbished one instead .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
i ' m out from us , i live in colombia , and maybe i can not return these laptop .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
i like the speed , the processor the hybrid storage units ( 128ssd and 1tera ) , but the web cam sucks , really poor resolution and the keyboard doesn ' t have the numerical part and the caps lock or num lock don ' t have any light or guide to help you .####[('keyboard', 'negative'), ('cpu', 'positive'), ('hardware', 'negative'), ('memory', 'positive')]
lightweight .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
yesterday the backlight went out .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
it was brand new out of the box , i ' ve never dropped it .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
now i have to deal with warranty stuff and sending it back etc .####[('warranty', 'neutral')]
ram upgrade available####[('hardware', 'positive')]
hard drive upgrade available####[('memory', 'positive')]
i had issues with the touchpad sticking or not responding to click correctly from the start .####[('hardware', 'negative')]
it ' s still a mainly functional computer , but using it is just not the greatest .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
we ' ve had the computer for 5 weeks , used it a total of less than 20 hours , and now it will be gone for 3 weeks .####[('laptop', 'neutral'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
i send it to asus warranty and now after a week they ' re sending it back stating the no problem was found .####[('support', 'negative')]
display stop working within 2 months .####[('display', 'negative')]
since it came with no user manual , i had to call asus customer support and got someone who knew all about windows 10 software but nothing about my asus notebook .####[('support', 'negative')]
after reading all the bad reviews , just sent it back for a refund .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
all over this asus laptop which has a non - functioning touchpad .####[('laptop', 'negative'), ('hardware', 'negative')]
my screen broke when just putting a textbook on it .####[('display', 'negative')]
don ' t even bother calling customer support , in my experience , they do you no good .####[('support', 'negative')]
keyboard needs to be redesigned entirely .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
6 ` ` screen is big enough to read with ease , yet the item itself is light enough to tote to meetings .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('display', 'positive')]
so far , this looks as if it meets my needs as a good ` ` work machine . ` `####[('laptop', 'positive')]
after exactly one year of useage this computer completely stopped working .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
it boots up in 10 seconds and shuts down in 2 to 3 seconds .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i like the idea that the keyboard lights up and has a ` ` time out ` ` feature to shut off .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
it seems put together well .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
what they lack in size , they make up for in raw speed , durability , and energy efficiency .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
+ decent quantity of available ports####[('ports', 'positive')]
+ it has a dvd drive : o####[('optical drives', 'neutral')]
- it runs hot !####[('laptop', 'negative')]
running grid benchmark , it got to a high 92 / 93 degrees c !####[('laptop', 'negative')]
- new i5 mobile processor .####[('cpu', 'neutral')]
- ddr4 ram that is upgradable .####[('memory', 'positive')]
- very decent battery life .####[('battery', 'positive')]
so far i am pleasantly impressed with this unit , however i have not used it a long time or tested many applications to date .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i can certainly say this is the best laptop i ' ve ever had ( but then again i ' ve only had 3 , and you would expect these things to improve over time , right ) .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i ' ve been using it for at least 4 hours since last charged in that 23 % used up .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
- as others have mentioned , the keyboard backlight turns off after just a few seconds of not typing , which can be annoying and there doesn ' t seem to be a way to change this .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
- easily upgradeable ram####[('memory', 'positive')]
one feature that i love is the ability to disable the touchpad from the keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
it ' s not fancy , but it ' s good value and fast and trouble - free .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('laptop', 'neutral')]
after spending some time with it , the feature can really be useful .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
easily upgrade to storage and ram .####[('memory', 'positive')]
this does not really matter to me because the mx150 is enough for my needs .####[('graphics', 'neutral')]
i love the solid state drive , as reviews or ads say you can boot up and get onto internet in 10 to 15 seconds .####[('hard disc', 'positive')]
it ' s not a ` ` gaming ` ` laptop even it can do some more casual gaming .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
it ' s super fast , boots up in seconds .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i am very impressed with this system .####[('os', 'positive')]
mastercam itself runs pretty good .####[('multimedia devices', 'positive')]
as usual amazon was great about returning it .####[('support', 'positive')]
screen is decent , not great , it is matte finished .####[('display', 'positive')]
i like the back lit keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
it ' s a lot of good for a comparatively cheap price .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the screen is perfectly adequate .####[('display', 'positive')]
this thing boots up super quick and it sleek and beautiful .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
google and partners have done great with chromebooks and have plenty of features to accommodate .####[('company', 'positive')]
i would highly recommend this to anyone , but especially to someone wanting something that is affordable , easy to use and just a bit more than a tablet .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i ' m getting very used to the multiple finger shortcuts on the touch pad when navigating chrome .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
this thing is still fantastic for what it is .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i chose to purchase a samsung chromebook this time just to try out a different company and because it was inexpensive ( i paid $ 189 .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i couldn ' t be happier with this product !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the screen hinge is super strong and it ' s hard to imagine it breaking unless you dropped it .####[('display', 'positive')]
the size is perfect , it ' s easy to toss it in my satchel or backpack along with my textbook and notebooks and have plenty of room .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
works great right out of the box , as advertised .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the battery life on this seems good .####[('battery', 'positive')]
this chromebook instantly connects to the internet .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
going to a grocery store or fitness center , the android tablets took so long to connect that i finished my shopping before they came online .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
everything is perfect .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
powers up immediately , great battery life , great keyboard , amazing features .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('keyboard', 'positive'), ('battery', 'positive')]
was considering an apple product but i ' m much happier with this !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this is my third samsung chromebook and i will continue to use this brand .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('company', 'positive')]
does not act like a tablet , but it can have almost 10 tabs open before affecting performance , including video streaming .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this was purchased for my son to download his high school textbooks for use .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
great price for a good book used for college students who carry all day####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i bought this refurbished and haven ' t experienced any issues .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this laptop is very straight forward .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
otherwise , it ' s great .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
also , secure os .####[('os', 'positive')]
the product itself is awesome .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
great little laptop and tablet !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the chormebook works as described by seller .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i like the size and features .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
however , still 5 stars as you get what you pay for : a cheap , decently rugged , light weight notebook to kick around and tinker with .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
love the keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
i am still getting use to the chromebook but i love it lightweight easy to bring with me as it doesnt take up much room !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i am so glad i purchased this and would definitely purchase again .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
since it is the same platform used at school the navigation was easy to get used too .####[('software', 'positive')]
great for going on the internet .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
it works well for her .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
we ran world of tank blitz ( using a game controller ) and roblocks on the low rez settings and experienced great appearance and ability to play .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
another little thing is the speaker isn ' t loud .####[('multimedia devices', 'negative')]
love it####[('laptop', 'positive')]
great battery life .####[('battery', 'positive')]
easy to take with and do homework on the go too !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i would recommend it to anyone .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this is perfect .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
battery life , speed , display and software were my additional top reasons why i went for the samsung .####[('battery', 'positive'), ('display', 'positive'), ('software', 'positive'), ('laptop', 'positive')]
the display is crisp and bright , setup literally takes under a minute , its fast , cheap , charges fast , lasts forever .####[('display', 'positive'), ('os', 'positive'), ('power supply', 'positive')]
nice , i ordered this just for simple web browsing and personal use .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i love my chromebook .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
it is taking me a while to get used to the small , tight keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
after researching for a high quality laptop that would not break the bank , i finally chose this one .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
delivery was a bit off but i blame usps on that , they suck in my area .####[('shipping', 'negative')]
amd a12 processor is quite fast when loading everything from an ssd .####[('cpu', 'positive')]
light for its size , not much flex in the body .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
stop what you ' re doing now and get this computer !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this computer is the best thing you can get under 400 dollars .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
great functioning computer .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
excellent laptop at a reasonable price .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this laptop does all i need it to do .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
works flawlessly and decent battery life .####[('battery', 'positive'), ('laptop', 'positive')]
excelente laptop####[('laptop', 'positive')]
great for graphics , nothing to complex but it can get the job done####[('graphics', 'positive')]
about what i was expecting / hoping it to be .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
it has been able to handle everything i ' ve needed for my business .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
it is fast enough for what we do , and it has all the features we needed for less .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
love our new laptop .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
battery could last longer .####[('battery', 'negative')]
light weight , good battery life , sharp screen .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('display', 'positive'), ('battery', 'positive')]
he is very content with it and its features####[('laptop', 'positive')]
great performance , quiet and cool processor .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('cpu', 'positive')]
the sims 4 ran very smoothly on regular graphics .####[('display', 'positive')]
i was really excited to get this laptop !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
runs first person shooters relatively well .####[('software', 'positive')]
would definitely buy this again if i needed to do so .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
laptop booted right up and the set up waa super easy .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the ones that do , doesn ' t have the numbering pad on the right side of the keyboard and i needed that .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
it ' s a very good lappy and i ' m happy with it , because it can still get all i need to do , done .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
nice and thin , light , surprised it has a dvd player in it .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
for my needs it ' s a perfect computer with one major flaw : battery life is much shorter than they advertise !####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('battery', 'negative')]
mine did lose its screen backlight suddenly when i ' d had it less than a month .####[('display', 'negative')]
fast processor .####[('cpu', 'positive')]
if you want a laptop ( not for gaming - reviews say - i have not tried ) get this one !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i think the battery is just undersized for the amd a12 apu .####[('battery', 'negative')]
this is an excellent laptop with a lot of heart .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the dvd player is a really nice touch as well , i didn ' t think i would use it but i definitely will in the future !####[('optical drives', 'positive')]
has all the available ports that i need .####[('ports', 'positive')]
laptop is very fast with 4cpu and 8gpu on board .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
great computer , you can play 2015 and below games on this computer .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
great laptop !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
she can stream music or videos , do her homework , and so on , so we are all pleased with our purchase .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
cpu performance does well .####[('cpu', 'positive')]
i bought this for college to do my homework and also pay my bills .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
really like it .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
played heroes of the storm with graphics up full and wasn ' t any lag .####[('graphics', 'positive')]
webpages load quickly .####[('software', 'positive')]
but i guess , it ' s got a lot of power going to that processor so you can ' t have it all .####[('cpu', 'neutral')]
for us , it was perfect .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i got ta say this was my first ever online computer / laptop order and let me tell you its pretty good .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i love how sleek and thin it is .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
great feel to the keyboard as well .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
this is a super fast computer and i really like it .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
it ' s so far a solid laptop that i can use for some gaming and school .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i purchased the laptop in august , and i already have a couple of keys popping off .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
i almost always keep it plugged in , so i can ' t comment on battery life .####[('battery', 'neutral')]
battery life is short , but plugging it in works .####[('battery', 'negative')]
sleek design .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
easy to use .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
nice computer for responsible grade school child .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this laptop is well engineered and designed .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this is a very nice laptop .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
it is perfect for everything i need it for .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
provided just what i wanted at a resonable price .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this laptop is fast and does what i need without problems .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
great price and great performance but terrible battery .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('battery', 'negative')]
it is a little slow .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
great computer , setup was fast and easy .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i am inlove with this laptop literally , it ' s nice size 15 .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
graphics are good for the level of this laptop .####[('graphics', 'positive')]
finally got the warranty honored after almost 6 months .####[('warranty', 'negative')]
plenty of buyer returned it since the touch screen has phantom touch problems right after unboxing or it will eventually happen within 3 months .####[('display', 'negative')]
consequently , i am no longer covered and my otherwise great chromebook becomes unusable anytime the phantom touches appear .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('keyboard', 'negative')]
i have tried to fix the pixel with online videos and websites with no effect .####[('display', 'negative')]
the beautiful screen is said to be identical to the pixelbook in size , aspect ratio , and resolution .####[('display', 'positive')]
after using the 3 : 2 aspect ratio , i think i prefer it to normal 16 : 9 , as far as chromebooks go .####[('display', 'neutral')]
it was fine for a solid two days , from there on it has been nonstop , reset to factory settings .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
idk if that ' s how chromeos usually is , or maybe there is something wrong with the hardware but this is very annoying .####[('hardware', 'negative')]
i get that this is meant to store everything in the cloud so it should be no big deal , but when your trying to get work done where there is no access to the internet ( since google docs works offline ) it is practically useless when it has to reset itself to factory settings just after turning it on .####[('os', 'negative')]
the touch screen works wonderfully .####[('display', 'positive')]
as others have noted , the backspace key is small .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
my biggest irk today though is that the screen is not very durable .####[('display', 'negative')]
hard reboot , reset , refresh + power , esc + refresh + power , charging , letting it drain , nothing brought it back to life .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
needless to say trip number three to best buy was a pure return , since being 0 / 2 on such an expensive device leaves a bad taste , you know ?####[('laptop', 'negative')]
gorgeous screen , small profile , lightweight , built in stylus , i could go on and on about how awesome this thing was .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('display', 'positive'), ('hardware', 'positive')]
this review might be dismissed as i am missing the ` ` verified purchase ` ` stamp , which is fair .####[('support', 'neutral')]
i wouldn ' t recommend this as a starting computer for children because they ' d learn incorrect navigation and have to adapt later to standard laptops .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
look , dont buy it .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
the screen does look good .####[('display', 'positive')]
terrible quality and not really enjoyable to use apps on the playstore .####[('laptop', 'negative'), ('software', 'negative')]
battery life its ok .####[('battery', 'neutral')]
then i got it home , worked with it for awhile , and realized just how easy it is to misfire unless you land dead nuts center in the middle of the key on your stroke .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
another star off for android app support , which simply isn ' t ready for prime time .####[('software', 'negative')]
i didn ' t find a single android app that was optimized for chrome os ( not that my search was exhaustive , admittedly ) , so was disappointed pretty much every time .####[('software', 'negative')]
battery life was mediocre , too , come to think of it .####[('battery', 'neutral')]
amazon gave me the option of returning for refund or trying to have it repaired .####[('support', 'neutral')]
battery is good , display and keyboard are pretty great .####[('battery', 'positive'), ('display', 'positive'), ('keyboard', 'positive')]
there ' s nothing ` ` pro ` ` about this tablet .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
unless it ' s a really bad baby and chromeos + samsung = bad baby !####[('company', 'negative'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
sounds nice until you realize that your computer just doesn ' t let you do things and then calls it secure .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
the keyboard lacks a backlight which is inconvenient in low light situations .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
when you stack up all these strengths and offer them at a price of $ 299 , you ' re getting a fairly impressive value proposition here with this chromebook .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
at $ 300 , this is a great purchase .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
which leads me to my next point , the omnipresent comments about ` ` this feels like a $ 1000 computer ! ` `####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this isn ' t say the acer is bad in the abstract ; far from it .####[('company', 'positive')]
it has a nice , oversize trackpad that - like pretty much all chromebooks - is responsive and a pleasure to use .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
the performance never lags , it meets the 10 - 12 hour battery life promise in my usage tests , and it ' s quickly become my go - to computer for both home and work .####[('battery', 'positive')]
this unit not only has a nice aluminum shell ( which is very attractive ) , but it also has a decent keyboard , with much better tactile properties than any chromebooks i ' ve looked at in the past .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
when i was comparing this model against other manufacturer ' s / model ' s , the only thing that made me pause was the lack of a card reader / writer .####[('ports', 'negative')]
i love it !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this isn ' t a powerhouse , i ' ve never pushed it , it probably wouldn ' t handle the 20 + tabs over multiple windows / desktops that i ' m used to on chrome on the desktop , but for 99 % of ` ` regular people ` ` this is an unbelievably good laptop .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the battery life is incredible and charges from 0 % to 100 % in about an hour and a half while in use .####[('battery', 'positive')]
overall , it performs well enough for my daily internet needs .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
my only wish is that it were a little more quick / less laggy given it is a chromebook - but for the price point its a great buy .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
little bit of a learning curve with chrome os .####[('os', 'negative')]
so it appears the play store does not recognize this devise at this time .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
chromebook seems like the kind of device that you review after a few weeks , and by the time anything happens to it that affects use , the replacement will be just as much or cheaper , twice as powerful , and come with ` ` angry birds ` ` installed by default .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
the hdmi and usb ports are on the left side , the back has no ports at all , and , misery !####[('ports', 'negative')]
the initial feel for this chromebook is superb .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the quad - core celeron n3160 gets a respectable near - 8000 octane score .####[('cpu', 'positive')]
this is a solid , well - balanced design .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
first time chromebook user , and this has been my favorite laptop ever .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i ' m been quite pleased at how well the chromebook has worked for all these tasks .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
as for software , chromeos is a decent thin - client operating system which can do more than most people think .####[('os', 'positive')]
i was hesitant at first because of the price , but i have to say that this is honestly an amazing machine .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('laptop', 'neutral')]
secondly , this is a really aesthetically pleasing machine .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
there are , as with everything , several growth opportunities for this model .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
secondly , the trackpad feels a bit delicate .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
the battery is good .####[('battery', 'positive')]
if you are looking for a laptop to check emails , watch movies , to shop , basic documentation , then this is an ideal one .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i have had q & a on this chromebook asking if it will download ms office .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
battery seems to be pretty good .####[('battery', 'positive')]
with the slow celeron processor , browsing does not feel snappy .####[('cpu', 'negative')]
this is my second chromebook and my next purchase will be a chromebase to replace my home pc .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
it does everything that i need and is surprisingly fast .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i want to cry because this doesn ' t support google play store !####[('laptop', 'negative')]
i ' m a graphic designer / gamer and my creative software operates with no problems and i ' m able to play the sims 4 and world of warcraft on very high settings with no problems at all .####[('graphics', 'positive')]
this is a huge plus !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
- drives are now solid state drive .####[('hard disc', 'neutral')]
- new built - in speakers .####[('multimedia devices', 'positive')]
- no dvd drive .####[('multimedia devices', 'negative')]
i couldn ' t drag - and - drop items in it , but after i changed the behavior in settings , everything went well from there .####[('hardware', 'neutral')]
it is pretty light if you are coming from any other laptop .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
very sharp screen and good viewing angles .####[('display', 'positive')]
something about os x running with a high resolution display just looks classy in a way that a windows computer could never match .####[('os', 'positive'), ('display', 'positive')]
no complaints here .####[('battery', 'positive')]
this computer is blazing fast .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
with os x yosemite , the os is very refined and elegant .####[('os', 'positive')]
the laptop works great and the package was delivered on time .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('shipping', 'positive')]
this thing is fast and efficient .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this computer is very high quality , do not believe anything on the market can touch it .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the backlighting is comparable , but the mbp gets brighter .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
the thunderbolt ports are a nice thing to have on the mbp .####[('ports', 'positive')]
the best laptop i ' ve owned .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
bought it for my grandson for college and he loves it .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
overall , this is an excellent machine .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
good durability , outstanding performance and portability .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
response is excellent .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
- battery life appears to be excellent####[('battery', 'positive')]
- laptop is light .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
- generous selection of ports ( this is in reference to the newer model )####[('ports', 'positive')]
- laptop is sleek and dare i say , sexy####[('laptop', 'positive')]

i love this macbook .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
great product####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this is an amazing computer i bought from cellelectronics .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
they put a lot of thought and work into making sure that the hardware and software work real well together .####[('hardware', 'positive'), ('software', 'positive'), ('company', 'positive')]
obviously great computer####[('laptop', 'positive')]
very nice laptop , i love its portable feature and the running speed is very fast .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('cpu', 'positive')]
the only issue i have with it ( and hence the four star rating ) is the battery life .####[('battery', 'negative')]
it is thinner , and lighter .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
awesome computer .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the shipping was fast and the seller was great####[('support', 'positive'), ('shipping', 'positive')]
the mac is great besides a chip under the mouse pad .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('keyboard', 'negative')]
the design is beautiful and the force feedback track pad is amazing .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('keyboard', 'positive')]
yeah the new mac book is lighter and only a little small but the internals are a lot slower .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('hardware', 'negative')]
love this computer !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
force touch trackpad , pretty freakin awesome .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
works like a charm and the retina display is super gorgeous .####[('display', 'positive')]
the laptop arrived in excellent condition .####[('shipping', 'positive')]
i absolutely love the programs that come with it ; how the mac itself functions , the appearance and quality of the mac .####[('software', 'positive')]
battery life thus far isn ' t nearly as long as i thought it would be , based upon video reviews of this model and item description .####[('battery', 'negative')]
this macbook is such a blessing and i would feel somewhat lost without it .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
if you ' re considering getting this macbook , proceed with confidence .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the ss hard drive has next to zero lag over traditional drives .####[('hard disc', 'positive')]
it ' s far away from meeting my expectations .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
i really like how it isn ' t bulky .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
great price and customer service####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('support', 'positive')]
however , i have an iphone and an ipad and the macbook does a great job syncing up everything on all three devises .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
laptop works perfect however i did get a used charger that only lasted a week .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('power supply', 'negative')]
awesome machine .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
costs a few bucks $ $ $ more but apple products are the best on the market .####[('company', 'positive')]
this computer is great for playing videos in a classroom setting of 10 people , connecting to an hdmi tv to show videos and powerpoints , and has a fantastic battery life .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('battery', 'positive')]
great price .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
great computer !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i ' ve been using this laptop for 1 year and no issues with the deliver nor the computer .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
great prodcut####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i did not like the new 2016 model due to the lack of ports and magsafe connector .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
shipping was fast and product came as described .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('shipping', 'positive')]
apple updates are easy .####[('software', 'positive')]
it arrived in great condition , and it ' s been working perfectly for me since i got it .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
high quaility computer in every way .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i like this machine quite a bit .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i was initially a little nervous as the system was somewhat glitchy for the first couple of weeks , seemed to be a problem with the chrome os because it was fixed by the next update .####[('os', 'negative'), ('os', 'neutral')]
took a week or so to get used to , but love it now .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
screen stays in whatever position you put it solidly enough to use the touchscreen .####[('display', 'neutral')]
battery : solid .####[('battery', 'positive')]
- speakers are a little tinny ( though the volume is awesome ) and it ' s not possible to customize the equalizer on the chrome os right now : (####[('multimedia devices', 'positive'), ('os', 'negative'), ('multimedia devices', 'negative')]
i mean , if you want a true tablet , buy a true tablet - - this did honestly keep me from investing in a kindle as i was planning to .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
i love that it is only as big as it needs to be to have a full - size keyboard ( not with a number pad , but full - sized keys ) .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('keyboard', 'positive')]
update it as soon as you turn it on !####[('software', 'neutral')]
my trusty windows 7 laptop was on its last leg and i opted to try something new .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
however , it comes with 100 gb of free google drive online storage .####[('hard disc', 'positive')]
the touchscreen looks good and is responsive , and the keyboard is nice .####[('display', 'positive'), ('keyboard', 'positive')]
people who complain that chromebooks are useless without internet access clearly are narrow minded and simply not thinking outside the box .####[('ports', 'positive')]
so i went to install my favorite screenwriting app , trelby , only to find its not available .####[('software', 'positive')]
maybe this thing does suck without an internet connection .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
and just like that , i realized that i can use my studio desktop wherever i want , whenever i want .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
it does make quite a loud click when you depress the button .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
overall : i like it and am happy for paying a bit over $ 200 for the 4gb model ( at the time of writing this , it sells for $ 220 new ) .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
one plus i ' m particularly happy about : a quiet fan - less device that doesn ' t heat up too much !####[('fans&cooling', 'positive')]
i have to say , i was somewhat hesitant purchasing this chromebook mainly because of some of the reviews .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
due to the excellent return policy on prime i decided to purchase this .####[('support', 'positive')]
i downloaded pandora and listened to all my stations at 3 / 4 volume and it sounded fine .####[('multimedia devices', 'positive')]
so far all but 1 of the android apps that i have tried have functioned properly , but some are restricted in the size of window that will work properly .####[('software', 'positive')]
laptop arrived dirty ( grimy screen and there was actual pet hair in the air vent ) .####[('fans&cooling', 'negative'), ('laptop', 'negative'), ('display', 'negative')]
i had to look up keys to press to get into a start up mode to even set up the computer####[('laptop', 'negative')]
i am not blaming the seller , i am blaming mac ' s os and its glitchy services .####[('support', 'negative'), ('support', 'neutral'), ('os', 'negative')]
but currently i am happy with it , the battery is ok , and its very aesthetically pleasing .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('battery', 'positive')]
ordered a macbook pro 13inch 256gb from this seller and with the exception of the power button , the keyboard and the trackpad wasn ' t working .####[('keyboard', 'negative'), ('laptop', 'negative'), ('hardware', 'negative'), ('hardware', 'neutral')]
the seller ' s description is that it was ` ` tested and fully functional ` ` and it wasn ' t .####[('support', 'negative')]
update : apparently the laptop sold to me was missing 5 screws on the inside that actually holds everything together .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
while yes , the charger does look great coming out of the box , plan on buying another shortly thereafter - and after , as long as your patience holds up .####[('power supply', 'positive')]
do not waste your time calling apple to see if there is anything they can do about it after 1 year ( unless of course you want to pay even more money on ' apple care ' ) .####[('support', 'negative')]
as much as i love the computer , and tout macbook to all my friends , for me , it stops here and now .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the anti - reflective coating will wear off and it isn ' t covered under apple ' s warranty .####[('laptop', 'negative'), ('warranty', 'neutral')]
the macbook pro offers a very dependable machine that will muddle - through anything you throw at it without complaining .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
2 usb ports and 2 thunderbolt ports on a $ 4500nz laptop ?####[('ports', 'negative')]
the ` ` ssd drive ` ` is not user replaceable .####[('hard disc', 'negative')]
the charger is defective and after 45 days of use the charger is shot .####[('power supply', 'negative')]
first impressions , excellent looking laptop and very light !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i love the keyboard and the trackpad - i finally get it now why both of these have rave reviews .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
the battery life is good - i get about 5 - 6 hours of non stop typing , with 3 browsers opened and wifi always on .####[('battery', 'positive')]
it ' s not stated anywhere that ' s it ' s used .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
didn ' t purchase from amazon but i can not believe these laptops have 5 stars .####[('company', 'negative'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
then one day , it stopped booting .####[('os', 'negative')]
my daughter loves it and it will be a great tool to help her through nursing school .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
apparently apple isn ' t even trying anymore .####[('company', 'negative')]
* very good battery life####[('battery', 'positive')]
it is not worth it .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
i ' m still absolutely blown away how apple , a supposed industry leader , has such horrendous functionality .####[('company', 'negative')]
i purchased this notebook back in july and was initially happy with my purchase .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
after numerous calls , i then received confirmation the warranty was valid , but only as a ‘ one - off ' .####[('warranty', 'negative')]
asus , has a horrible reputation .####[('company', 'negative')]
my final verdict - it ' s somewhat solid as a device now that 6 months of updates and delays are behind us .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
bright enough for all uses , and 1080p is perfect - images are sharp .####[('display', 'positive')]
- battery life is solid , right around what is claimed - probably 7 to 10 hours depending on variables such as screen brightness and how demanding you ' re being with it .####[('battery', 'positive')]
- touchscreen is responsive enough for gaming .####[('display', 'positive')]
i absolutely imagine chrome apps picking up drastically in quality and quantity now , since it seems like chrome os is really coming into its own this year .####[('software', 'positive')]
- in tablet mode , the screen looks too ‘ tall ' to feel natural ( see the attached picture ) .####[('display', 'neutral')]
this screen ratio makes it look great in desktop mode .####[('display', 'positive')]
after 3 months of use the unit will no longer charge .####[('power supply', 'negative')]
if it is indeed a software thing and it ' s fixed , i would highly recommend this device .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
second issue is with scaling of the ui .####[('software', 'negative')]
the screen itself is hd 1080p but most ui elements don ' t look good in this resolution .####[('software', 'negative')]
unless the app is specifically designed to access google drive files , the app has no way to read and save files directly to the cloud .####[('software', 'negative')]
• great battery life .####[('battery', 'positive')]
• volume is incredibly low .####[('multimedia devices', 'negative')]
i would like a quick fix but have not found one that would allow me to consider keeping this beautiful asus chromebook .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
then i one night i plugged it in and woke up to a dead chromebook .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
it ' s too heavy to really use as a tablet .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
transfer speeds ( lan to nas ) were miserably slow ( 10 - 30mbps ) .####[('ports', 'negative')]
it was perfect with no backlight bleed , no shimmery matte texture , no uneven backlight , no dead / stuck pixels .####[('display', 'positive')]
this product was fantastic - - great build quality , screen resolution , keyboard - - until one day it stopped turning on .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('display', 'positive'), ('keyboard', 'positive'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
i ' ve been repairing products for years and it was clear this was a power _ supply issue .####[('power supply', 'negative')]
if this device weren ' t nearly $ 500 i might expect it to only last a year , but at this price point it ' s unacceptable .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
some of the things i wanted to do with this notebook were limited by the os .####[('os', 'negative')]
the laptop was great , lightweight , booted fast , simple to use .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
even just this last month it still rates ( on several tech sites ) as one of the best overall chromebook lines to get .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the asus customer service people are rude and have no answers .####[('support', 'negative')]
things were fine until the unit stopped charging .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('power supply', 'negative')]
this is the problem with companies today .####[('company', 'negative')]
asus customer service sucks .####[('support', 'negative')]
i call customer service , first they argue and say customer damage then to try and placate me they say they have an adp accidental damage and protection plan one time for one year .####[('support', 'negative')]
it is a beautiful , well built laptop .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
that ' s nutty for an expensive premium product .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
asus what the heck were you thinking when you designed this product ?####[('company', 'negative')]
i seriously love the product but i may have to return it .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
now i only leave it charging until it ' s full but the battery time is still decreasing .####[('battery', 'negative')]
very impressed with my first chromebook .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i don ' t use it as much in tablet mode as i thought as it is a little heavy when in that configuration .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
i had high hopes for this tablet / computer based on customer reviews .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
google docs work fine .####[('software', 'positive')]
a chromebook does most of what i need , except gaiming .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
second , and most annoying , it would not identify my printer in cloud print .####[('ports', 'negative')]
so , guess i ' m screwed , because now after 6 months my tpm is no longer working and the whole computer is useless .####[('hard disc', 'negative'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
product is sturdy , lightweight , fast , and the battery runtime was as advertised !####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('battery', 'positive')]
i had to buy a mouse because the touchpad is very sticky .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
not at all pleasant to use also , the screen quality is just so - so .####[('laptop', 'negative'), ('display', 'neutral')]
and not buy any asus product again####[('company', 'negative')]
the third one is ok but has a dead pixel .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
i ' ve contacted amazon and asus and no response .####[('support', 'negative')]
this piece of crap won ' t hold a wifi signal or has a really weak signal .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
several of my chrome extensions perform poorly and have to be disabled altogether which degrades my work production experience .####[('software', 'negative')]
however , 1 ) the speakers on this thing are horrible .####[('multimedia devices', 'negative')]
battery life is not good .####[('battery', 'negative')]
but screen is very weird .####[('display', 'negative')]
the intel m3 processor is amazing , this thing can do a ton of multi - tasking and the google play store is nice to have , the android apps variants trump the chromebook pre - loaded apps .####[('software', 'positive'), ('cpu', 'positive')]
a great chromebook , but stopped charging in 3 months .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
i was really excited to purchase this product because it was more affordable .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
chromebooks are cool , but they dont last at all .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
hey this machine is extremely useable and functionable .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
battery no longer charging .####[('battery', 'negative')]
furthermore , the file system is extremely complicated to use .####[('os', 'negative')]
the display panel on the machine i received is warped .####[('display', 'negative')]
half the time it doesn ' t want to turn on and just flashes .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
the machine looks great from the hardware point , but the whole concept of chrome os and cloud applications sucks .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('hardware', 'positive'), ('software', 'negative'), ('os', 'negative')]
in the middle of using , it rebooted , then went into an endless boot loop , so i tried to reset it to factory default , now it says chrome os is missing or damaged .####[('os', 'negative')]
the screen hinge feels weak .####[('hardware', 'negative')]
screen is average by 2017 standards .####[('display', 'neutral')]
the chromebook is brilliant overall .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
google provides zeros customer support related to the os .####[('support', 'negative')]
horrible product .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
tech support is no help unless you are willing to part with your computer for months without guarantee of return .####[('support', 'negative')]
i am having a very difficult time with this chromebook .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
it freezes constantly and needs to be shut off to start again .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
the microphone does not work with regular speaker .####[('multimedia devices', 'negative')]
the tablet mode is horribly integrated with the os and applications .####[('laptop', 'negative'), ('software', 'negative'), ('os', 'negative')]
i tried returning the second one bu it does n ' t give me the option to return it .####[('support', 'negative')]
this is nothing more than an okay laptop to get you through basic work activities .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
overall it ' s one of the nicest chrombooks out there .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
however , mine came with an annoying trackpad .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
the top metal monitor casing seems to be soft and bendable .####[('hardware', 'negative')]
mine arrived with the metal screen casing slightly bent , i can easily bend it back , not sure about the durability of this thing in the long term .####[('display', 'negative')]
however , shortly after i received it , a buzzing sound started coming out of the right side usb port .####[('ports', 'negative')]
so chromebook with some manufacturing issues + bad customer service####[('support', 'negative'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
they 1080 screen makes the fonts to small for this size screen .####[('display', 'negative')]
i find the chromium os to be very limiting and would not recommend it over a cheap windows pc .####[('laptop', 'negative'), ('os', 'negative')]
the keyboard is fantastic , but it ' s just a keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
the touchpad is also some strange off color plastic .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
1 - faulty trackpad resulting in jerky erratic cursor movement relative to the smooth movement of your finger .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
i then noticed a dead pixel on the screen .####[('display', 'negative')]
however , if you want a really speedy chromebook , it ' s great .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the first unit i received shortly died after a few hours of usage .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
i like the addition of the cooler boost button , but most of the time i don ' t have to use it because i have a thermaltake auto laptop cooling pad that monitors the bottom surface of my laptop .####[('fans&cooling', 'neutral')]
trackpad is ok .####[('keyboard', 'neutral')]
wireless card is finicky with both units i had .####[('hardware', 'negative')]
my laptop seems to lose its internet connection at random times .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
after being on the phone with technical support and windows support for a combined 10 hours , i am told that the hardware is defective and must be replaced .####[('hardware', 'negative')]
run like heck from this machine .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
it will break , even if it works at first .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
this laptop isn ' t even 30 days old yet .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
literally just closing it and opening it up later was a 50 / 50 proposition if it would wake up , or the display would crash , or the disk would crash , or some driver would fail - on a brand new laptop .####[('hard disc', 'negative'), ('laptop', 'negative'), ('software', 'negative'), ('display', 'negative')]
hook up the cat5 and the machine is screaming at high speed and exactly what i was hoping for .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
by the time i was returning it , the system was in such poor shape from the msi .####[('os', 'negative')]
i believe if you happen to uninstall / install the drivers in exactly the correct order and / or do a clean win 10 installation yourself , this laptop should perform well for the price .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the sound is really terrible and tinny .####[('multimedia devices', 'negative')]
it ' s fast .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
excellent product####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i ' ve always liked msi for their performance and fairly decent price .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
it was actually more like 1h45m and this was also after optimizing the battery .####[('battery', 'negative')]
so , four days after buying this laptop , it stopped booting .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
for the four days i used it , it worked pretty good .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
this laptop is not worth the time and definitely not the money .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
we call tech support together and the guy who answers is just so not interested in helping .####[('support', 'negative')]
i am extremely disappointed with this laptop .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
update : this is by far and away the worst computer i have ever purchased .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
got the second laptop , died within a month and same thing .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
this kept plaguing the laptop as more problems kept piling up including various bsod errors mostly involving the hardware .####[('laptop', 'negative'), ('hardware', 'negative')]
poor design and terrible tech support .####[('support', 'negative'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
this computer is amazing !####[('laptop', 'positive')]
quite like this laptop so far , only writing this review so early from owning it to receive that nice msi headset .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('multimedia devices', 'positive')]
not too happy with msi , likely to return this laptop .####[('company', 'negative'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
this laptop was great starting out of the box .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
their support page is very buggy , and the support people are unhelpful .####[('support', 'negative')]
sooooo i would avoid this and i ' m pretty much avoiding the optane drive which may have been part of the issue .####[('graphics', 'negative')]
after this issue i finally decided to return my product .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
good luck this customer tech support and msi has absolutely no idea how to help you .####[('support', 'negative')]
i ' ve had to do a factory reset on this piece of garbage 4 times and i ' ve only owned it for 4 months .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
you can feel the plastic bending if you pick up the laptop with one hand .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
i really loved this laptop .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i will never own another msi product .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
now i feel bad buying this for my child , as this laptop seem to have a solid rating elsewhere .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
so i ' m stuck with a 3 month old laptop that does n ' t work .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
eventually got to the point that even when i reinstalled windows it was so slow that there are clearly serious build defects / instabilities on this product .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
when it is functioning it works great .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
finding out you bought garbage for the steep price of $ 700 + .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
overall a decent laptop if not for these problems , also , the laptop has minor screen freezes even while playing low graphical games like league of legends .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
laptop malfunctioned and stopped working after only 3 months .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
it does have a nice screen that is very bright , decent viewing angle and ok for contrast .####[('display', 'positive')]
the keyboard is very nice and very responsive .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
i love the fast bootup time with the optane memory , a nice alternative to a very expensive ssd .####[('os', 'positive'), ('memory', 'positive')]
the charge doesn ' t last like the five hours it stated but instead last three hours .####[('power supply', 'negative')]
had it for a month and it ' s riddled with problems .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
as others have said , the only downside is the slow 5400 rpm 1 tb hard drive .####[('hard disc', 'negative')]
+ very good ips matte fhd panel , zero reflections , almost zero light bleed , average brightness .####[('display', 'positive')]
used as bought , it is an ok laptop , but not great ( probably a 3 star value ) .####[('laptop', 'neutral')]
- no ethernet port ( not that i ' ve used or needed one that i can recall )####[('ports', 'negative')]
no backlit keyboard .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
it has plenty of power for most tasks .####[('power supply', 'positive')]
the only weak point of the laptop is the hard drive it come with , but luckily this laptop is extendable - 2 ram slots and one m .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i paid $ 500 for a 15 ` ` notebook with 8gb ram , latest i5 - 8250u cpu with reasonable weight and its quite extendable , i am happy for this deal .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
also , i ' m not a fan of the delete and power button being next to each other , now i see what the other people are complaining about accidentally shutting it off .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
haven ' t had any issues yet so pretty glad i chose this .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
very nice looking laptop for the money .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
features windows 10 , sharp display , and card slot for m .####[('os', 'positive'), ('display', 'positive'), ('ports', 'positive')]
great quality computer .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
like the flip , this has good build quality .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
so far it has been able to handle everything i ' ve thrown at it .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
all in all , pretty good stuff .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
2 and this laptop is an epic powerhouse for under $ 700 .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
very good laptop if you want something lightweight for everyday browsing .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
excellent hardware , however i ran into some nasty trouble after updating windows 10 .####[('hardware', 'positive'), ('os', 'positive')]
so , shortly after buying it i had to format it .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
and just now , the computer says it is plugged in but not charging .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
the fingerprint reader works most of the time .####[('hardware', 'positive')]
the sound is fine for me but not as good as external speakers .####[('multimedia devices', 'positive')]
not that this machine boots up slow .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
great value for a laptop .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
love the 15 inch screen in the body of a 14 inch body .####[('display', 'positive')]
cheaply made plastic but performance is well worth the trade for a $ 500 laptop .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
touchpad works well .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
the speakers are mediocre and don ' t put out too much volume and are sensitive to position .####[('multimedia devices', 'neutral')]
i do like the screen on this , images are clean and crisp , enjoying the 4 gigs of ram which allow me to have a few more tab open .####[('display', 'positive'), ('memory', 'positive')]
i like how it ' s so simple , without so much clutter and complexity .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i ' m still keeping this as a backup or additional laptop because of its cheap price .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
anyways , i really would of liked to have kept the chromebook as it was the perfect weight , size , and design for my upcoming college semester .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
laptop would never power on , even after being charged for 24 hours .####[('power supply', 'negative')]
i want to love this laptop because it is so lightweight and sleek .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
it ' s decent .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
ssd hardware issue####[('hard disc', 'negative')]
note : support for amazon is making it good and immediately sent me the return label , bought through third party but i will get my money back , thank god for amazon customer service####[('support', 'positive')]
the return procedure is so elaborate that i may decide to just write this purchase up as one big mistake .####[('support', 'negative')]
daughter opened it for christmas and it doesn ' t stay on .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
they keyboard felt responsive and was a good size .####[('keyboard', 'positive')]
i am very close to just returning it and never buying another acer product ever again .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
i will give them props for the build quality .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
combine these items together and this item became very frustrating .####[('laptop', 'negative')]
- exceptional keyboard and touchpad feel####[('hardware', 'positive'), ('keyboard', 'positive')]
- below average screen brightness about 200 nits , average is 250 - 275 .####[('display', 'negative')]
as you can see from the reviews it worked out fine for most people .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
when i sent it back to acer to repair it they simply claimed it had water damaging and couldn ' t fix it .####[('support', 'negative')]
my acer aspire e 15 worked great for a day , and then shut off by itself .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('laptop', 'negative')]
by june 2018 , the keyboard stopped working , and i had to do an unplug and reboot .####[('keyboard', 'negative')]
now given that without the issue they are a nice laptop .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
good performance for the price and my intention as the support for my family was to have everyone on these with a spare to deal with ones that break down .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
i purchased this computer because it came highly rated by consumer reports , pc magazine , and other raters .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
the reason why i ' m giving this laptop a two star is because overall i think the quality of it is good especially for the price .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
can not remove the battery .####[('battery', 'negative')]
i too have the black screen problem .####[('display', 'negative')]
computer is fine but the speakers broke after 1 week of use .####[('laptop', 'positive'), ('multimedia devices', 'negative')]

- the physical case is solid and of a production quality you ' d expect in machine 3 - 5x the price of this machine####[('laptop', 'positive')]

all and all , it ' s a light weight , but very robust development stack , that also has the added convenience of cloud9 ' s collaboration features wherein multiple developers can be writing code in even the same file simultaneously .####[('os', 'positive')]
thus far , i ' ve loaded a number of games , my password vault , several productivity apps , skype , spotify and some network scanning android apps and they ' ve all worked very well .####[('software', 'positive')]

for instance , the android youtube app doesn ' t work well at all because it ' s very inconvenient to get videos into full - screen mode .####[('software', 'negative')]
it seems pretty fast .####[('laptop', 'positive')]
so i ' m very happy and relieved to see it working excellently on the c302 .####[('laptop', 'positive')]

i found the display to be very vibrant , with excellent pixel density .####[('display', 'positive')]
i like the dispersion of ports and feel it helps with the ergonomics of your daily usage .####[('ports', 'positive')]
