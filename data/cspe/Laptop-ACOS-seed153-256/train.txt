i have been beyond pleased with this laptop purchase over the last 6 months of use .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]

i wish the camera was a little better , but it ' s great otherwise .####[('multimedia devices general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
the only problem that i have found about lenovo is that it comes with a program called migration , which is supposed to migrate your things from your old computer to your new computer .####[('software design features', 'negative')]
if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
very good purchase .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the price was great during prime days .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
price and product , outstanding .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
this device ( and its brother the plus ) has a grave hardware flaw that causes the touchscreen to move on its own .####[('hardware operation performance', 'negative'), ('display operation performance', 'negative')]
ridiculous for something so expensive , some internet research shows numerous people having this issue .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
the pixels are currently stuck .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of keyboards and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .####[('keyboard general', 'negative')]
it does indeed look excellent !####[('display design features', 'positive')]
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
there is a power button on the side which i have accidentally hit quite a few times .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
except , you know , when it decided to become unusable .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####[('keyboard general', 'negative'), ('laptop design features', 'negative')]
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'negative')]
no caps lock on the keyboard .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
bought this for someone else , can ' t believe how good it is .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it take a bit of getting used to .####[('keyboard usability', 'neutral')]
it ' s great in many ways ; the build is solid , the screen is good ( and the resolution is insane ) , and the keyboard is decent , though only time will tell if it ' s as diet coke - resistant as the samsung ' s keys are .####[('laptop quality', 'positive'), ('display design features', 'positive'), ('keyboard design features', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
never has it run out of power while on battery .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]

great device for browsing the internet .####[('laptop miscellaneous', 'positive')]
battery life is excellent , and i can get several days use before needing to plug in .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
with chrome remote desktop i am able to play turn - based video games such as hearthstone or civ 5 while miles away from the computer actually running them .####[('software usability', 'positive')]
first of all , this is a physically beautiful machine .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
i purchased this chromebook strictly for writing / editing ( i ' m an independent and published author ) and web browsing .####[('laptop usability', 'neutral')]
losing the function keys for a toucher was a deal breaker .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
i don ' t like this .####[('ports general', 'negative')]
the keyboard is ok .####[('keyboard general', 'neutral')]
the display is excellent !####[('display general', 'positive')]
i ventured back to the macbook pro world and purchased this model after much research .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
laptop in perfect condition .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
laptop is as described .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it didn ' t come with the box but it came with the charger and so far , i ' ve only been using for a few days , but i have no issues with the item at all .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the display is amazing and the new force click trackpad is an awesome addition .####[('display operation performance', 'positive'), ('keyboard general', 'positive')]
i love this computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
slim , very fast , great screen , lightweight , solid state drives , great battery ( even though it burns the battery life when i play my flight simulator due to processing demands of the graphics ! )####[('display general', 'positive'), ('battery operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the pro is by far the best .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
january 21 , 2016 update : i love this laptop even more than before .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i ' ve only had it for one day and the set up was easy , and all items delivered were present , will update over time !####[('os usability', 'positive')]
the display clarity is outstanding .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
it is a great laptop !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
one year later and the laptop is still in great condition !####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the macbook pro is everything i hoped for and more .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
very nicely packed in original box .####[('shipping general', 'positive')]
works great !####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the retina display is stunning .####[('display general', 'positive')]
i bought this chromebook on the prime day deal , but even without $ 60 off it would still have been worth the money .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
i thought the gizmo was neat but i was disappointed that i couldn ' t really use it the way i wanted to it that regards .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i could even watch videos and game from the laptop itself ( to an extent ) .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
that is just incredible .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
in preparation for becoming a chromebook user i had purchased a 256 gig memory card and moved all my laptop files to it .####[('memory general', 'neutral')]
every app i have downloaded from the google app store has worked perfectly .####[('software operation performance', 'positive')]
i fixed it , however it took intensive research to fix it .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
as it turned out the thunderbolt ports are of no use .####[('ports usability', 'negative')]
the machine looks amazing doesn ' t it !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i ' m pretty sure i ordered the biggest size , and i got the smaller one , but whatever it shipped fast and it works great .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('shipping general', 'positive')]
have not heard any complaints about the product .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
- for such a premium price , this is definitely the worst purchase quality wise that i have made .####[('laptop price', 'negative'), ('laptop quality', 'negative')]
your new retina screen will get stains on it from the top layer seperating and or dead pixels .####[('display quality', 'negative')]
i originally purchased this at the beginning of april after about a week it stopped charging ( would receive ` ` low power charger ` ` connected message and not charge ) .####[('power supply operation performance', 'negative')]
but this asus , who offered so much & rated over 4 stars , turned to a black screen , just over a month after i received it .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
we ' ve got android nougat on beta running pretty well now .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
the c302 is clean and feels solid .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
this is a nice perk to save battery life and for folks who like to read / / browse late at night in bed and do n ' t want the backlighting on .####[('keyboard design features', 'positive')]
and apparently amazon is experiencing a supply shortage because my replacement isn ' t expected until sometime between jan 11th to feb 5th !####[('support general', 'negative')]
i loved this chromebook , it worked great for six months .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
now the romance is over ; it won ' t charge , and my only option is to send it in for service , a 10 - day event not including shipping there and back .####[('power supply operation performance', 'negative')]
i also decided that despite the advantages of the asus , i can not live with the sharp edges and middling volume .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'negative')]
aluminum outer body , usb c charging from either side of the chrombooke , backit keyboard , nice screen resolution and fast processor .####[('cpu operation performance', 'positive')]
i can plug it in and put it back to sleep and it will charge , but if i haven ' t woken it up it won ' t begin to charge .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
the main bad for this particular variant is that google is no longer going to support it with updates .####[('support general', 'negative')]
so be forwarded , if you buy this , you are jumping right into a machine that won ' t get updates anymore ( which is something most chromebook owners want and a feature that makes them better than android and it ' s fragmented market ) .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
but today i noticed it ' s cracking ( ref : pics ) .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
it is the nicest chrome computer i have ever owned .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it surfs the internet fast .####[('laptop connectivity', 'positive')]
the key board and mouse pad are not very sensitive .####[('keyboard quality', 'negative')]
cursor won ' t move and touchscreen won ' t work and from reading about this online i am not alone with this issue .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'negative'), ('display operation performance', 'negative')]
nice screen , nice feel .####[('display quality', 'positive')]
chromebook is 2 months old and charger stopped working .####[('power supply operation performance', 'negative')]
i still love the laptop , i ' m just a bit disappointed by this and i hope it ' s the only issue i see .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
moreover i ' m quite upset because it seems amazon will not pay me back the shipping fees , which for me amount to about 100 $ as i live in france .####[('shipping general', 'negative')]
i much suspect that google ' s half baked sustem is at fault .####[('os general', 'negative')]
the first week i had my chromebook it locked up .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
this product is built well , but it won ' t run the one android app i hoped it would run , and for whatever reason the app and os update download speeds are abysmal .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i loved this chromebook but i had to return it bevause it had sound issues .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
but after three charge cycles the screen started vibrating vigorously from side - to - side .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
manufacturing seems unreliable .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
the screen is great and the unit is fast .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
everything was good for a few days after receiving the product .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
very disappointing in an otherwise great product####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
very fast product , but with this kind of technology it ' s not possible to use a program , that i work ( minitab ) .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it simply refuses to boot .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
laptop runs really well but fans get a bit loud when gaming####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('fans&cooling operation performance', 'negative')]
however , i tried to power it up today and kept receiving an error message right at startup that was a ` ` system boot violation ` ` .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
it only comes with 8 gb or ram not 16 .####[('memory design features', 'negative')]
the keys feel nice and responsive however the mouse pad is a little over responsive .####[('keyboard general', 'positive'), ('hardware operation performance', 'negative')]
the monitor looks fantastic , but i still cant get over the fact that you are basically lied to aboit memory availability .####[('display design features', 'positive'), ('memory general', 'negative')]
the computer ' s hardware is decent , but the materials are poor .####[('laptop quality', 'negative'), ('hardware general', 'positive')]
do not buy this computer !####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
cpu and gpu are good , ram is good and i like the keyboard .####[('cpu general', 'positive'), ('memory general', 'positive'), ('keyboard general', 'positive'), ('graphics general', 'positive')]
its battery life is really good , and the led lights are nice .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
do not buy this .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
don ' t recommend it .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
- caps lock without a led notification , not so clever .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
quiet keyboard .####[('keyboard design features', 'positive')]
the only thing i don ' t like is that the power button sits beside the delete key .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
good screen .####[('display general', 'positive')]
the screen on this looks great , the bezels aren ' t noticeable .####[('laptop design features', 'neutral'), ('display design features', 'positive')]
i bought this laptop for software development .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
the notebook is very well built and it could easily pass as a high - end machine .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('laptop quality', 'positive')]
only thing i ' d change would be the hard drive .####[('hard disc general', 'negative')]
purchased this mid november , because of the 8th gen i5 , and other good specs for the great price .####[('cpu general', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
what this tells me is that the hdmi port on my chromebook is defective .####[('ports connectivity', 'negative')]
i can ' t really testify to its battery - life as i have not used it to the point where the battery is totally dissipated .####[('battery operation performance', 'neutral')]
i have mixed feelings about this acer chromebook .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
now my main complaint is that is it very slow , especially for a new computer !####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
computer was used very little and stopped working after 6 months####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i ' ve had it for less than two months it randomly shuts down .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
trackpad keeps breaking .####[('hardware operation performance', 'negative')]
11 months after the purchase , it died .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
the touchpad is quite sensitive i ' ve noticed , not a big issue to me .####[('hardware operation performance', 'neutral')]
the laptop build is cheap looking and basic , but functional to say the least while i save up money .####[('laptop operation performance', 'neutral'), ('laptop quality', 'positive')]
below medium build quality####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
about 4 hours of battery####[('battery operation performance', 'neutral')]
it ' s fast at processing , fast for web browsing and has a quick startup .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
after the ssd upgrade , the computer is very fast .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('hard disc operation performance', 'positive')]
the hard drive sounds like a distant lawn mower .####[('hard disc operation performance', 'negative')]
this thing is slow !####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
this is a painfully slow computer .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
- track pad is accurate####[('hardware operation performance', 'positive')]
they are clearly working with more than one person at a time , and not effective multi - taskers .####[('support general', 'negative')]
also tech support gave incorrect product info !####[('support general', 'negative')]
with my first day of use everything was terribly slow and updates took hours .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
this computer completely shut down after 2 months .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
it felt flimsy , but decent .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'negative')]
windows 10 alone runs slow on this but once you install some 3rd party programs like adobe photoshop or illistrator , this laptop is unuseable .####[('os operation performance', 'negative'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i ' ve been waiting for this chromebook for some time now and having only had it for about two weeks , i can say that the device and purchase were well worth it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the surface texture of the case is a satiny paper - like touch , which is both clean and easy to wipe down , but also not so smooth that you have to be concerned with it slipping out of your hand when carrying it .####[('laptop usability', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive')]
- backlit keyboard rocks####[('keyboard design features', 'positive')]
it was an excellent machine for the money and it also got me spoiled with its touch screen .####[('display operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
the default scaling 1536x864 looks excellent and sharp to me .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
i ' m typing this review in a dark room , and it reminds me how much i love this backlit keyboard .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'positive')]
again , this is where the build quality really shines .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
the addition of the play store puts the device into a sweet spot no other device can come close to matching .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
one , the display is gorgeous ; watching video is a treat .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
the core m3 allows this system to get fast and to stay quiet .####[('cpu operation performance', 'positive')]
boot speed : likewise , very fast -####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
everything is either good or excellent in quality .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
- the keyboard is great and has a nice gentle / quiet click to it .####[('keyboard usability', 'positive'), ('keyboard general', 'positive')]
the display is perfect for me , plenty of brightness and a decent resolution .####[('display design features', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
the usb - c ports are nice and i found that a completely dead battery to fully charged time was about an hour .####[('ports general', 'positive'), ('power supply operation performance', 'positive')]
* battery - i can not really speak to the battery life yet , but as a power user with lots of tabs and several apps open , it is giving me a days use 5 + hours of use so far .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
it ' s one of the best chromebook in the market if not the best .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i love my c302 !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
love the keyboard more than its predecessor .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
only problem i have had , which was from the moment i started using it is the audio .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
nice build quality , very fast and beautiful display .####[('laptop quality', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
the computer itself is sturdy and feels well - made , though the keyboard is a bit smaller than i ' m used to .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative'), ('laptop design features', 'positive')]
i knocked off a star for build quality control .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
the display is clear .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
battery life appears to be pretty good too .####[('battery general', 'positive')]
i really like this chromebook .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
this is a great device if your main goal is to check email , surf the internet listen to music or watch videos .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i have to say that the keyboard is my favorite feature .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
i purchased this machine on cyber monday for $ 375 ( $ 75 off the listing price at the time of this review ) and i think at that price point , it ' s well worth it .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
the startup time is ridiculously fast , and just opening the laptop will turn it on and get you going on chrome within 10 seconds - i ' ve had as many as 12 tabs open , and it still ran smoothly .####[('os operation performance', 'positive'), ('software operation performance', 'positive')]
outstanding laptop .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
track pad is passable .####[('keyboard general', 'neutral')]
so i went ahead and ordered the c302ca , and after a week of use there are no issues to report .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i ' m loving this thing .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i like it , good construction , can load android apps .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
great display .####[('display general', 'positive')]
the speakers are not great , but bluetooth connection to an external speaker is standard these days and it ' s how we watch movies .####[('ports connectivity', 'positive')]
overall , i am very happy with this purchase , and i am in love with the simplicity of the google ecosystem .####[('out of scope usability', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
i ' d say the only drawback might be the speakers .####[('multimedia devices general', 'negative')]
the keyboard is also one of the nicest most comfortable i have ever used .####[('keyboard usability', 'positive')]
overall it has been a wonder experience and quality product .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
the keyboard has excellent travel and just feels right .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'positive')]
the volume and backlit - keyboard brightness controls also do not work properly .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'negative'), ('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
i have to say , this is a very nice product .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
this asus worked right out of the box and was very responsive .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
i didn ' t want to spend much on this as it is my first laptop , but i was convinced by a few reviews to upgrade to this model as it has more ram and performs better in several areas .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
an awesome product , well built - well worth your time and money .####[('laptop quality', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
the keyboard is nice to type on .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'positive')]
