update : i repaired it myself for $ 12 .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
this works fine for that .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
we ordered this chromebook for my son to use for school .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
when switching between tablet and laptop mode quickly the screen will blink and turn off for an extended period of time before turning back on .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
it was nice when it was working .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it feels like a tablet / computer for a child since it ' s so bulky and heavy .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
i really think it ' s junk .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
runs good , poor battery life .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('battery quality', 'negative')]
i even tried reinstalling the drivers and doing a system restore , nothing would fix it .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
i was so glad that the problem would finally be fixed .####[('power supply general', 'positive')]
to my great dismay and disappointment , the power icon read the exact same message : ` ` plugged in , not charging ` ` .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
i ' ve only found 2 other recent reviews of this product that had the same problem ( go ahead and search for them in the reviews ) .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
the built - in speaker is below average .####[('multimedia devices general', 'negative')]
im returning it .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
feel like at max brightness it just isn ' t enough .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
no backlit keyboard is kinda a bummer but i digress .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
i went with the asus vivobook based on the good specs , better hdd and ram , reviews , and because i could pay for it over several months .####[('memory general', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive'), ('hardware general', 'positive')]
edit : reinstalled the driver now the audio is better on earphones .####[('multimedia devices general', 'positive')]
with ssd lightning fast start up####[('memory operation performance', 'positive')]
no back light keyboard####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
performance is mediocre####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i like the laptop for it ' s hardware , and it ' s working properly .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('hardware general', 'positive')]
the actual laptop is very much darker and blue .####[('laptop design features', 'neutral')]
the new computer failed again with the same error .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
the computer constantly pauses or stutters and then continues when it comes to loading web pages and working on documents .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
not happy with this one .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
the computer worked well for a few weeks , then the screen backlight died .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('display operation performance', 'negative')]
will never buy an asus product again .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
no backlighting on the keyboard .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
the fan blows like crazy and it makes so much noise .####[('fans&cooling operation performance', 'negative')]
i would not recommend you buying this laptop , the specs are fine for the price , but the hardware is rubbish .####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('hardware general', 'negative'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
all around , a very lacking laptop .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
this computer arrived fine but will not charge .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
how can a brand new computer not charge properly ?####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i received this laptop promptly .####[('shipping general', 'positive')]
i could n ' t have put my feelings about my new acer aspire e 15 e5 - 576g - 5762 better .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
overall impression : this is a killer laptop for a killer deal !####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
: p ) , and the machine is definitely zippy .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
oh , and the nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least ( grid autosport fps avg is in the 80s / 90s or so )####[('graphics operation performance', 'positive')]
+ great and fast cpu and overall fast pc performance####[('cpu operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####[('laptop price', 'positive'), ('display design features', 'positive')]
this laptop is the best for the price in my opinion .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
i have been beyond pleased with this laptop purchase over the last 6 months of use .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it is also amazingly quiet : the ssd doesn ' t make any noise , and the fan only spins up if i am doing something intensive like playing games or running a heafty program - just browsing or watching videos / basic office work will not make this computer more than whisper .####[('hardware operation performance', 'positive')]
additionally , this has a nice backlight to the keyboard , which will turn off when nothing has been pressed for about 20 seconds ( great for when just watching or reading something ) or can be manually turned off entirely .####[('keyboard usability', 'positive')]
in addition , you are gifted with an sd card reader and an optical drive which can read and write cds and dvds ( which i can ' t say i ' ve used other than testing that it worked , but i do remember how hazardous it is to suddenly need something like that and not have it available ) .####[('optical drives operation performance', 'positive')]
- the keys , often described as mushy , still have a decent click and distance to them .####[('keyboard design features', 'positive')]
- i swear my screen periodically changes brightness but i can ' t tell if this is my imagination or not .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
- windows 10 ( do i really need to list the drawbacks of 10 ?####[('os operation performance', 'negative')]
great laptop for expansion and upgrade .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
screen is bright , doesn ' t feel heavy .####[('display design features', 'positive')]
the screen looks good despite some other reviews .####[('display general', 'positive')]
after running good for the initial 25 first days it won ' t power on .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i still find the one piece touch pads unreliable to use even after all the tweaking .####[('hardware operation performance', 'negative')]
my first time with a solid state drive , very nice quick and quiet .####[('hard disc operation performance', 'positive')]
i will painfully learn the new pads .####[('hardware usability', 'negative')]
the screen is more than sufficient for non - gaming , business use , and it seems as fast as expected .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####[('hard disc design features', 'positive')]
to get the features like this good luck .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i have the intel core i7 , soooo fast !####[('cpu operation performance', 'positive')]
love the cortana !####[('software general', 'positive')]
was very easy to add memory .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
the acer is similar but bigger and heavier .####[('laptop design features', 'negative')]
i have been using a chromebook now for three years and am totally satisfied .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
chromebooks are light weight and start up immediately and are very easy to use .####[('laptop usability', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
i love this chromebook !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
occasionally it will get sort of slow and then i ' ll go to settings and clear the image cache and that takes care of it .####[('laptop operation performance', 'neutral')]
the keyboard is nice .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
first time chrome os user , very streamlined and easy to use .####[('os usability', 'positive')]
i can carry both of them in a reasonably sized purse and not hurt my shoulder .####[('laptop portability', 'positive')]
if you ' re going to be doing a lot of heavy lifting , this might not be the chromebook for you .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i ' m travelling overseas with it , and it goes everywhere i do and does everything i do - except i can no longer multitask and annoy my mother in video calls !####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]

i was very surprised at how fast it came .####[('shipping operation performance', 'positive')]
i am very happy with this purchase .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the battery seriously lasts as long as i need it , and i ' m one to forget to charge it .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
not as much i can do on it , but it is adequate .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
which , to be sure , is great , i had just hoped for something slightly more agile .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
google docs are getting so good and user friendly who needs office anymore , content accessible anywhere , just takes a little time to get used to but once you realize all the benefits chromebook is a great choice .####[('laptop quality', 'positive'), ('software operation performance', 'positive')]
every additional feature would be unnecessary for my personal usage .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
the battery will last a full day or two so it ' s very good for a middle school student .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
such a perfect little computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
battery life is excellent and our students love them !####[('battery general', 'positive')]
it works great for what i need .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the battery life is outstanding and the quality is great .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop quality', 'positive')]

its is small and lite and the battery dose last long .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive')]
i ' m satisfied with the product .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]

very satisfied with simplicity of use , the streamlining of the google products , and the considerable battery life .####[('laptop usability', 'positive'), ('battery operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive')]
battery life is superb####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
he ' s very happy with it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]

1 month update : chromebook is still working great .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
everything works great .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
has all the top features and runs fast .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
solid chromebook .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
i like the ease of connecting to the internet wi - fi .####[('laptop connectivity', 'positive')]
i woudlnt recommend more than 10 active tabs which slows down some of the functionality but otherwise runs smoothly for students####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
this item is excellent and not bad for the price .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
works well for writing novels which is what i bought it for .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
surprisingly fast for such a small chrome book .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
another thing , it is much thinner than expected .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]

if you need a decent computer that runs quality this is it , especially if you are starting out .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
fast delivery , thanks to amazon .####[('company general', 'positive'), ('shipping operation performance', 'positive')]
pros : nice size , clear screen , quick on start up , very functional and easy to use .####[('laptop usability', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
it ' s also very lightweight , so it ' s easy to carry around .####[('laptop portability', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive')]
also audio is pretty decent .####[('multimedia devices general', 'positive')]
but if you keep it plugged in it ' s great !####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it works like it is made to run linux .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
love this laptop####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
great computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
that said if you ' re not a computer savvy no worries as soon as you turn it on cortana the computers assistant walks you through everything that you need to do .####[('os general', 'positive')]
this is a brand i look for that i feel i can trust .####[('company general', 'positive')]
nice little computer for the price .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
i wish the camera was a little better , but it ' s great otherwise .####[('multimedia devices general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
it ' s not real fast and it doesn ' t have a lot of storage .####[('hard disc general', 'negative'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i don ' t ask much of a laptop so i am happy with it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it ' s fast , connects quickly to wifi , and the screen is quite nice .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop connectivity', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
the only problem that i have found about lenovo is that it comes with a program called migration , which is supposed to migrate your things from your old computer to your new computer .####[('software design features', 'negative')]
no problems with this computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
fast to start up .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
runs great - however , i just tried to upload my small adventure videos and the built in video player stops mid video about 10 seconds in - audio continues .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
i have yet to update the drives on it or try a game but so far its a good machine .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i recommend buying it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
very good purchase .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the price was great during prime days .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
price and product , outstanding .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
it look like a professional laptop but overrall get this laptop you wo n ' t regret it , no negativity about it####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
works well .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
this device ( and its brother the plus ) has a grave hardware flaw that causes the touchscreen to move on its own .####[('hardware operation performance', 'negative'), ('display operation performance', 'negative')]
ridiculous for something so expensive , some internet research shows numerous people having this issue .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
now there are pixels on the screen not working , and they are multiplying .####[('display quality', 'negative')]
the pixels are currently stuck .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
no matter where on earth , you can get your apple product repaired .####[('support general', 'positive')]
i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of keyboards and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .####[('keyboard general', 'negative')]
it does indeed look excellent !####[('display design features', 'positive')]
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
there is a power button on the side which i have accidentally hit quite a few times .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
except , you know , when it decided to become unusable .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####[('keyboard general', 'negative'), ('laptop design features', 'negative')]
you know , i wanted to love this machine .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'negative')]
the problem is that it never charged .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
the cable functions just fine .####[('power supply operation performance', 'neutral')]
reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .####[('laptop quality', 'negative'), ('display operation performance', 'negative')]
no caps lock on the keyboard .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
samsung sent me a new stylus free of charge and free of hassle , which was nice of them because the top of the oem stylus popped off one day and could not be reassembled .####[('hardware general', 'negative'), ('hardware general', 'positive')]
i keep it at about 60 - 70 % and it looks fantastic .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
bought this for someone else , can ' t believe how good it is .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it take a bit of getting used to .####[('keyboard usability', 'neutral')]
as other reviews have mentioned - its a bit heavier than expected for such a slim frame .####[('laptop design features', 'negative')]
it ' s great in many ways ; the build is solid , the screen is good ( and the resolution is insane ) , and the keyboard is decent , though only time will tell if it ' s as diet coke - resistant as the samsung ' s keys are .####[('laptop quality', 'positive'), ('display design features', 'positive'), ('keyboard design features', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
more importantly i appreciate the uncanny speed to boot up or wake up .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
never has it run out of power while on battery .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
the 1080p display is very sharp .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
great device for browsing the internet .####[('laptop miscellaneous', 'positive')]
hulu app is not supported for this computer so you will need to use the browser .####[('laptop design features', 'negative')]
i love how slim the design is - will fit easily into my backpack : ) highly recommend for everyday or school use !####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
the chrome rdp app also works well , connecting to my windows machines with good performance , and i can access files on my nas using network file shares after using the chromebook for the last couple of weeks , i ' d confidently recommend one for everything but gaming and special purpose applications .####[('laptop miscellaneous', 'positive'), ('software operation performance', 'positive')]
battery life is excellent , and i can get several days use before needing to plug in .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
with chrome remote desktop i am able to play turn - based video games such as hearthstone or civ 5 while miles away from the computer actually running them .####[('software usability', 'positive')]
you can ' t use it to edit a word document .####[('os usability', 'neutral')]
very easy to set up and light to carry .####[('laptop usability', 'positive'), ('laptop portability', 'positive')]
we actually returned the first acer chromebook 14 , we got because the screen would blink randomly and go off .####[('display quality', 'negative')]
guaranteed excellent customer service !####[('support general', 'positive')]
first of all , this is a physically beautiful machine .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
in summary , it looks great and performs very well .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
i purchased this item 7 months ago and i love it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i purchased this chromebook strictly for writing / editing ( i ' m an independent and published author ) and web browsing .####[('laptop usability', 'neutral')]
losing the function keys for a toucher was a deal breaker .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
i run windows and linux vms fairly regularly and while i could run them on a comparable windows system , adding windows systems to an already portly windows system has never worked out well for me , so while disappointed in the new upgrades , this 2015 model still rocks vms and does all i need it too for far less $ $ $ .####[('software usability', 'negative')]
when the computer is working hard , it doesn ' t burn my lap anymore ( although i do feel some hot air flowing through my fingertips , when i am typing , but i am okay with that ) .####[('fans&cooling general', 'positive')]
i don ' t like this .####[('ports general', 'negative')]
the keyboard is ok .####[('keyboard general', 'neutral')]
it ' s nice and lightweight , the sd port is useful , and it ' s powerful enough for me to do fairly layer intensive graphic design work in photoshop and basic grading in lightroom .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive'), ('ports usability', 'positive')]
the keys feel fantastic to type on .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'positive')]
the display is excellent !####[('display general', 'positive')]
i was due to upgrade and this product seemed perfect for me .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####[('software general', 'neutral'), ('software operation performance', 'negative')]
adobe apps are also power hogs , but that is to be expected .####[('software operation performance', 'neutral')]
it works great !####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
as far as gaming performance , the m370x does quite well .####[('graphics operation performance', 'positive')]
i ventured back to the macbook pro world and purchased this model after much research .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
all - in - all , i have been extremely satisfied so far with this purchase and am enjoying my not - so - cutting edge purchase .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
but the mac looked and worked great .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
laptop in perfect condition .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
laptop is as described .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it didn ' t come with the box but it came with the charger and so far , i ' ve only been using for a few days , but i have no issues with the item at all .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
i always was a huge fan of apple and i always thought the price on the macbook pros were too steep but i finally took the plunge and i ' m satisfied .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
it came exactly as advertised .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the display is amazing and the new force click trackpad is an awesome addition .####[('display operation performance', 'positive'), ('keyboard general', 'positive')]
as a refurbished item it was indistinguishable from a new item .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i love this computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
slim , very fast , great screen , lightweight , solid state drives , great battery ( even though it burns the battery life when i play my flight simulator due to processing demands of the graphics ! )####[('display general', 'positive'), ('battery operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the pro is by far the best .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the retina screen does an excellent job of not tiring my eyes after a long day of computer work .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
1 - itunes match ( $ 25 / yr i believe ) keeps all of your music synced across all of your ios devices with no limit .####[('software general', 'positive')]
january 21 , 2016 update : i love this laptop even more than before .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i ' ve only had it for one day and the set up was easy , and all items delivered were present , will update over time !####[('os usability', 'positive')]
overall , i ' m very happy i chose this model .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the display clarity is outstanding .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
it is a great laptop !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
one year later and the laptop is still in great condition !####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the macbook pro is everything i hoped for and more .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
small light portable , excellent screen , very fast performance and soo quiet , does this have a fan ?####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
fast delivery , brand new as expected .####[('shipping quality', 'positive')]
very nicely packed in original box .####[('shipping general', 'positive')]
computer came in good condition and at a good price .####[('shipping general', 'positive'), ('shipping price', 'positive')]
works great !####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the retina display is stunning .####[('display general', 'positive')]
i bought this chromebook on the prime day deal , but even without $ 60 off it would still have been worth the money .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
my only complaint is the click on the touchpad feels a little cheap , but i just use ` ` tap to click ` ` so it ' s not an issue .####[('hardware operation performance', 'negative')]
when i recieved the item i was amazed at the quality of it .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
nothing on it feels cheap at all .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
i boot it up and notice quickly the display seems to be 720p ( or something close ) but for what i need this thing to do .####[('display operation performance', 'neutral')]
i use some other apps but nothing is quite the same for my workflow .####[('software design features', 'negative')]
i thought the gizmo was neat but i was disappointed that i couldn ' t really use it the way i wanted to it that regards .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i could even watch videos and game from the laptop itself ( to an extent ) .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
that is just incredible .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i chose this one mainly because of the full size keyboard , larger screen , and full size hdmi .####[('display design features', 'positive'), ('keyboard design features', 'positive'), ('ports design features', 'positive')]
yes , this chromebook comes with the android app store pre - installed .####[('laptop design features', 'neutral')]
although 4 gigs of ram doesn ' t seem like a lot to some of us , because of the simple software , it is very fast with no lag .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('software design features', 'positive'), ('memory quality', 'neutral')]
the power button is no longer on the keyboard , but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
in preparation for becoming a chromebook user i had purchased a 256 gig memory card and moved all my laptop files to it .####[('memory general', 'neutral')]
every app i have downloaded from the google app store has worked perfectly .####[('software operation performance', 'positive')]
of course , i have only had this acer for a week .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
i fixed it , however it took intensive research to fix it .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
as it turned out the thunderbolt ports are of no use .####[('ports usability', 'negative')]
the machine looks amazing doesn ' t it !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
apple should ashamed to be associated with this cheap , lousy , clearly inferior , plastic nightmare - but then again , maybe that is exactly what they do want , so profits soar .####[('laptop price', 'negative'), ('company general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'negative')]
i ' m pretty sure i ordered the biggest size , and i got the smaller one , but whatever it shipped fast and it works great .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('shipping general', 'positive')]
have not heard any complaints about the product .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
- for such a premium price , this is definitely the worst purchase quality wise that i have made .####[('laptop price', 'negative'), ('laptop quality', 'negative')]
your new retina screen will get stains on it from the top layer seperating and or dead pixels .####[('display quality', 'negative')]
had it for a week now and still finding things it can not do .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i originally purchased this at the beginning of april after about a week it stopped charging ( would receive ` ` low power charger ` ` connected message and not charge ) .####[('power supply operation performance', 'negative')]
but this asus , who offered so much & rated over 4 stars , turned to a black screen , just over a month after i received it .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
lo and behold , i hadn ' t read quite all of the 1 * reviews : the worst was a teacher who had ordered so many for her several classes and said ` ` i think the problem is with the motherboard .####[('motherboard quality', 'negative')]
we ' ve got android nougat on beta running pretty well now .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
the stock video player misses audio on a lot of movies , and using the vlc app ( android ) is super buggy ( frequently freezes and shuts down ) .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
the c302 is clean and feels solid .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
this is a nice perk to save battery life and for folks who like to read / / browse late at night in bed and do n ' t want the backlighting on .####[('keyboard design features', 'positive')]
this is now my fastest - charging device .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
i tired every remedy found online , and even got in touch with asus tech support who just said ` ` send it back ` ` .####[('support general', 'negative')]
and apparently amazon is experiencing a supply shortage because my replacement isn ' t expected until sometime between jan 11th to feb 5th !####[('support general', 'negative')]
i loved this chromebook , it worked great for six months .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
now the romance is over ; it won ' t charge , and my only option is to send it in for service , a 10 - day event not including shipping there and back .####[('power supply operation performance', 'negative')]
overall i like the portability and battery life on this device .####[('battery quality', 'positive'), ('laptop portability', 'positive')]
google ' s own services like google docs , drive , and gmail don ' t respond well to touch screen gestures often leaving me in despair .####[('software design features', 'negative')]
• occasionally hangs for 10 - 30 seconds with no response from keyboard or trackpad####[('keyboard operation performance', 'negative')]
i also decided that despite the advantages of the asus , i can not live with the sharp edges and middling volume .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'negative')]
aluminum outer body , usb c charging from either side of the chrombooke , backit keyboard , nice screen resolution and fast processor .####[('cpu operation performance', 'positive')]
then about 3 months in , it quit charging from the supplied fast charger .####[('power supply operation performance', 'negative')]
i can plug it in and put it back to sleep and it will charge , but if i haven ' t woken it up it won ' t begin to charge .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
as of the time of writing , the audio drivers are still not working , but i typically don ' t care for that anyways .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
the main bad for this particular variant is that google is no longer going to support it with updates .####[('support general', 'negative')]
so be forwarded , if you buy this , you are jumping right into a machine that won ' t get updates anymore ( which is something most chromebook owners want and a feature that makes them better than android and it ' s fragmented market ) .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
but today i noticed it ' s cracking ( ref : pics ) .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
it is the nicest chrome computer i have ever owned .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
after about 60 days use the power adapter / charger stopped working .####[('power supply operation performance', 'negative')]
- battery sucks .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
build quality is excellent ( was .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]

it surfs the internet fast .####[('laptop connectivity', 'positive')]
the key board and mouse pad are not very sensitive .####[('keyboard quality', 'negative')]

extremely disappointed as this was a gift to my husband .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
this is a great machine in many ways - - and with crouton could run full ubuntu , which made it a great little machine to write code on and deploy to a server .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
nice screen , nice feel .####[('display quality', 'positive')]
not super confident this asus unit will last half that long .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
chromebook is 2 months old and charger stopped working .####[('power supply operation performance', 'negative')]
this is exactly what i needed in a laptop .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]

the battery is far below what i expected .####[('battery quality', 'negative')]

i much suspect that google ' s half baked sustem is at fault .####[('os general', 'negative')]
10 months in my battery will no longer charge .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
the first week i had my chromebook it locked up .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]

and the screen was changing like creazy .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
i loved this chromebook but i had to return it bevause it had sound issues .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
after seven months , the usb - c ports stopped charging .####[('ports operation performance', 'negative')]
now the hole thing crashed out of nowhere and i ' m going to lose everything i had on it .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
the screen is nice .####[('display general', 'positive')]
but after three charge cycles the screen started vibrating vigorously from side - to - side .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
the tablet is good also , however can ' t they design something that covers the keyboard during tablet mode .####[('os design features', 'neutral')]
manufacturing seems unreliable .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]

the computer ' s hardware is decent , but the materials are poor .####[('laptop quality', 'negative'), ('hardware general', 'positive')]
it took hours to restore to factory default settings , and it crashed once again days later .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]

what this tells me is that the hdmi port on my chromebook is defective .####[('ports connectivity', 'negative')]
i can ' t really testify to its battery - life as i have not used it to the point where the battery is totally dissipated .####[('battery operation performance', 'neutral')]
we ' ll it ' s been a few weeks now with this chromebook now , aside from the initial issue , no problems .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
i have mixed feelings about this acer chromebook .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
it ' s still good for basic internet usage .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]

the surface texture of the case is a satiny paper - like touch , which is both clean and easy to wipe down , but also not so smooth that you have to be concerned with it slipping out of your hand when carrying it .####[('laptop usability', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive')]

the battery life is not anywhere near the advertised 8 hours .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
boot speed : likewise , very fast -####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]

cons : no caps lock key ( still haven ' t found it , help ! )####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
i purchased this machine on cyber monday for $ 375 ( $ 75 off the listing price at the time of this review ) and i think at that price point , it ' s well worth it .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
the startup time is ridiculously fast , and just opening the laptop will turn it on and get you going on chrome within 10 seconds - i ' ve had as many as 12 tabs open , and it still ran smoothly .####[('os operation performance', 'positive'), ('software operation performance', 'positive')]
the touchscreen is great though and feels very intuitive .####[('display general', 'positive')]
