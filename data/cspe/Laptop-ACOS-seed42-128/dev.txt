google is expecting to add that in sometime in the next year .####[('company general', 'neutral')]
thankfully , this time , acer has gotten that part right .####[('company general', 'positive')]
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####[('laptop quality', 'negative'), ('display general', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]

if i had it to do over , i would not purchase this computer .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
