overall , it is not horrible , but i wouldn ' t purchase this model again .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
- screen feels smaller than other of the same size .####[('display design features', 'negative')]
it also refuses to charge past 90 % and instantly jumps to 80 % when i unplug it .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]

the computer constantly pauses or stutters and then continues when it comes to loading web pages and working on documents .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
should ' ve stick with my pixelbook which was awesome and never have me trouble .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i would not recommend you buying this laptop , the specs are fine for the price , but the hardware is rubbish .####[('hardware general', 'negative'), ('laptop price', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'negative')]
thanks to its ssd , it boots windows 10 pretty fast , bloatware is kept to a minimum ( please uninstall norton before doing anything else .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
- trackpad is too finicky and not my favorite####[('hardware usability', 'negative')]
as of now , for $ 600 or less , this is a nice buy .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
best pc bang for this level of buck .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####[('hard disc design features', 'positive')]
the screen looks great ( though maybe not if all you do is look at 4k resolution ) and the keyboard response feels pretty good .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'positive'), ('display design features', 'positive')]
for the price , it ' s a solid laptop .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
first time chrome os user , very streamlined and easy to use .####[('os usability', 'positive')]

so far no problems except i tried to print something from my email and am having trouble linking to my printer .####[('laptop connectivity', 'negative')]
this is a great notebook .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
package arrived faster than the estimated arrival .####[('shipping operation performance', 'positive')]
i woudlnt recommend more than 10 active tabs which slows down some of the functionality but otherwise runs smoothly for students####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
choose this one .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the computer has a solid processor and enough memory to handle pretty much anything the average user willl throw at it , short of graphics - heavy gaming .####[('memory quality', 'positive')]
beautiful resolution####[('display general', 'positive')]
you just have to deal with a low battery and that ' s all####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
it was easy to set up .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
so before you get angry do your homework on why the laptop may be acting strange .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
also can not just ` ` add ` ` memory ddms : only one socket means you must remove the 8gb and purchace a 16gb ( ~ $ 180 further investment ) ; battery not gon na last several hrs , looking at ~ 2 - 4 .####[('memory general', 'neutral'), ('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
the only draw back with this pc is the battery life which lasts about 3 hrs before needing to be charged .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i like the size but dislike the battery life .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('battery general', 'negative')]
i will see if samsung honors their warrnty , if so , i will probably change / update this review .####[('company general', 'neutral')]

i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
awesome display .####[('display general', 'positive')]
mouse track pad is non standard .####[('hardware operation performance', 'negative')]
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####[('hardware operation performance', 'negative')]
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .####[('display general', 'positive')]
certain apps ( especially flash based apps ) will get the machine very hot .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
the keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
bought this for someone else , can ' t believe how good it is .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]

overall , the way i see it , i ' m getting a big screen hd android galaxy tablet with a keyboard for the price of a tablet .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
while usb - c is cool , a bag full of dongles is not .####[('ports general', 'positive')]
that is awesome .####[('hard disc general', 'positive')]

sadly after barely a year old it crashes all the time , the touch screen rarely works , and the track pad stops working until a reboot on occasion .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'negative'), ('display operation performance', 'negative')]
i will never buy another asus after this experience .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
today , it stopped powering on .####[('power supply operation performance', 'negative')]
i love the way it looks and feels the only thing i can complain about is the fact that none of these electronics come with printed manuels anymore also dont know anything about the camera only see me .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('multimedia devices usability', 'negative')]
the chromebook seems to be working fine now and my daughter does love it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it began to shut down and restart all on it ' s own - continuously .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
second where the heck is my other 8 gigs of ram ?####[('memory general', 'negative')]
i ' ve never had a computer as fast as this .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it took hours to restore to factory default settings , and it crashed once again days later .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
it ' s a very fast laptop .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
i definitely recommend this if you are looking for a good gaming laptop .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]

this unit is a great compromise between powerful cpu and gpu with good battery life .####[('cpu operation performance', 'positive'), ('graphics operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive'), ('battery general', 'positive')]
the screen sits too close to the keyboard and you will end up with scratches on the screen .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
the laptop itself seemed fine at first .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i hate to knock acer as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new product and then not being able to turn it on to use it .####[('company general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'negative')]
usb ports are too hard to plug and unplug####[('ports usability', 'negative')]

chrome has come a long way to be sure and in its optimized avatar on this system its very snappy .####[('software operation performance', 'positive')]
the good news is that the android features ( google play store apps ) work nearly across the board .####[('software operation performance', 'positive')]
