this unit is ` ` pretty ` ` and stylish , so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
for now i ' m okay with upping the experience & device to 3 out of 5 stars .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
seems unlikely but whatever , i ' ll go with it .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
this version has been my least favorite version i ' ve had for the following reasons listed bellow the pros .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
- biggest disappointment is the track pad .####[('hardware general', 'negative')]
should not of bought this chromebook .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
the keyboard is stiff and unresponsive to my typing at times .####[('keyboard quality', 'negative')]
the chromebook r 11 was hardly used and only a few months old .####[('laptop usability', 'negative')]
one day it just would not power up .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
some apps don ' t work but the play store is still in beta right now####[('software general', 'negative'), ('software general', 'neutral')]
but do not dare will only be good for playing games maybe it will get better .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
after some use , the battery charge had logically gone down some ( down to about 80 % ) , and so i went back to my office to plug it in .####[('battery operation performance', 'neutral')]
asus customer support was through chat and cumbersome .####[('support general', 'negative')]
i had it on my desk and was watching youtube videos and it went black .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
the screen is very dim however .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
don ' t buy this machine .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
sounds like a good deal for a $ 620 laptop but battery doesn ' t perform as promised i am hardly getting 4 hrs .####[('laptop price', 'positive'), ('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
external speakers were decent sounding until right one gave away and now is heavily distorted at even mid vol .####[('multimedia devices general', 'negative'), ('multimedia devices general', 'positive')]
screen is good .####[('display general', 'positive')]
keyboard is decent with good travel .####[('keyboard portability', 'positive')]
thin bezels allow for a compact frame####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
overall this is a good system for the price and i do recommend the ssd for the price .####[('hard disc price', 'positive'), ('os price', 'positive')]
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####[('company general', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
if you can save for 750 - 800 i would recommend going up a bit in the asus line .####[('company general', 'positive')]
it seems like there is a problem with the processor because it constantly starts and stops while i ' m trying to surf the web .####[('cpu general', 'negative')]
bought this on may , barely used it and now 4 months later it ' s randomly shutting down every few minutes .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
pros : lightweight and looks nice .####[('laptop portability', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
this computer is loud !####[('laptop design features', 'negative')]
i am so disgusted and disheartened by my dealings with asus support , it ' s hard to believe .####[('support quality', 'negative')]
returned because had it less than a month and it decided to go crazy and start typing by its self ect .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
this computer has wasted so much of my time already .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
it still is nice looking with a textured cover and being black overall .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
it opens programs immediately .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
i do not think i will need to upgrade the ram .####[('memory general', 'neutral')]
acer made a winner here !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
+ backlight kb and travel feels pretty nice on the keys .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'positive')]
the ports were another thing that i was really excited to see fully included on a laptop in this price range .####[('laptop price', 'positive'), ('ports general', 'positive')]
i ' ve been happy being able to plug in and run overwatch from time to time on this laptop , with higher settings .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
this is the best laptop for the price .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
i like that it ' s got the 8th generation i5 cpu .####[('cpu general', 'positive')]
it ' s pretty fast for a laptop especially a laptop in this price point .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
i would knock a star for the hard drive size since it ' s incredibly small but at this price you can easily pick up large one to add if you want to and it ' s not like you aren ' t warned when you buy it .####[('hard disc miscellaneous', 'positive')]
the picture clarity is amazing and the backlit keyboard is awesome .####[('display quality', 'positive'), ('keyboard design features', 'positive')]
can ' t beat it for the price .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
also love that access to the hd / ssd and ram slots is really easy .####[('memory design features', 'positive')]
acer seems to be the only one who puts together stuff like this .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it boots in seconds although i usually just leave it on constantly .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
- the battery life is excellent ( i get 6 - 8 hours of normal university student usage out of it ) and even when i ' m using it , it charges as fast as my phone .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
however , other than video calls it does really well .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
- the spacebar is finicky .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]

i loved mine , so i got her the same one .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
can ' t really find a viewing angle where all of it looks right at the same time .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
very easy to set up .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
the chromebook was packaged well and we saw no defects ( ours was used ) .####[('shipping quality', 'positive')]
it is a basic little laptop and i love it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the battery life is incredible and literally lasts all day , not to mention it charges to 100 % in about an hour and a half .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive'), ('power supply operation performance', 'positive')]
linux is a fairly light os depending on the distro you use .####[('os design features', 'positive')]
there is a lot of ' bang for your buck ' in the lenovo ideapad 320 .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
low rpm hdd .####[('hard disc operation performance', 'negative')]
my only fair complaint is that it occasionally restarts itself without warning ( usually no more than once every day or two ) .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
excellent laptop good speed on uploads and download .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
love the screen resolution .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]

at a ` ` black friday ` ` price , this computers specs could not be beat for the value to dollar performance ratio .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
nice keyboard .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
i have always loved loved the kindles .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
my only complaint is that the mouse keypad is a little big .####[('mouse design features', 'negative')]
so , i have had this laptop for almost a week and have put it through the ringer .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
only thing i really didn ' t like about this was how quickly the battery drained .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
i have n ' t used it much for gaming but i imagine it works fine .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
my kids have played roblox and minecraft on it along with fortnite so i think it can handle online gaming pretty good .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
if you ' re big on aesthetics then you ' ll love the look .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
i will never use another microsoft program as long as i live .####[('software general', 'negative')]
it has a full size keyboard , a number pad , a camera , and great big screen !####[('display design features', 'positive'), ('keyboard design features', 'positive'), ('keyboard design features', 'neutral')]
this is just perfect .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
very happy with this laptop although not a fan of windows 10 .####[('os general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
navigates well .####[('out of scope general', 'positive')]
using it for doing programming , app development , and electronics projects .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
so far i ' m enjoying it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it is very good for the price .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
google is expecting to add that in sometime in the next year .####[('company general', 'neutral')]
i was skeptical ordering this because of the conflicting reviews .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
which is really sad because in the time i could actually use the chromebook i absolutely loved it .####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
many apps aren ' t ` ` compatible ` ` and even the ones that work , they look awful .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
another expensive & poorly executed samsung product .####[('laptop price', 'negative'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
thankfully , this time , acer has gotten that part right .####[('company general', 'positive')]
things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .####[('laptop quality', 'negative'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
for home users , these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two - screening , to watching videos and calling family .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
as a 5 - year chromebook veteran , i ' ve been waiting for this machine .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####[('cpu operation performance', 'negative'), ('cpu price', 'positive')]
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####[('laptop quality', 'neutral')]
i was pleasantly surprised at how good it is .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
as a windows and mac user , i wasn ' t sure if i could benefit from using chromeos , but i find myself using it more than i anticipated .####[('os general', 'positive')]
- new ports that were not in the 2011 model : hdmi port , extra thunderbolt video port ( now it has two instead of one )####[('ports general', 'positive')]
honestly , i think nobody uses these ports anyway .####[('ports general', 'neutral')]
maybe that ' s a consequence of how the retina display is built , but yeah , it ' s harder to keep the screen clean .####[('display general', 'negative')]
i do wish the screen were bigger , but i had to go with the 13 ` ` due to budget constraints , so that ' s on me .####[('display general', 'neutral')]
these macbook pro computers are expensive .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
i think for others they are just buying into the brand .####[('company general', 'neutral')]
i love the retina display .####[('display general', 'positive')]
i am extremely happy with this laptop .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it doesn ' t effect any of the functionality , but it was a little disappointing to open the box to see a dent on something i ' d just spend $ 1 , 000 on .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
neat and sleek build , great display and very nice os####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('os general', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
the new touchpad takes a little getting used to , but otherwise it ' s been perfect .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('keyboard general', 'neutral')]
the retina screen is amazing .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
battery life is a huge plus !####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
such a nice mac####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
price was very good and met my expectations also shipping was very quick .####[('laptop price', 'positive'), ('shipping general', 'positive')]
however , i have to remove one star for the very unreliable magnetic charging connector .####[('power supply design features', 'negative')]
this laptop has all the necessary ports .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
as i bought 13 inch model , it is very portable .####[('laptop portability', 'positive')]
i ' ve been extremely impressed by this device .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
overall : i ' m super happy with this product .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it feels responsive to me , and i went to settings to customize the speed , clicking , and scrolling .####[('hardware operation performance', 'positive')]
the only drawback is that it only comes with 32 gb of hard drive .####[('hard disc design features', 'negative')]
configuring the printer was a little tricky but not bad .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'neutral')]
my desktop runs all my video editing software for my bigger and most demanding projects and mylaptop is great for editing video and running pc games in places other than my home ( like school ! )####[('laptop miscellaneous', 'positive')]
either they were so slow i couldn ' t get any work done or they just flat out broke after a couple months .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i have not had any freezing or screen flashing issues .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
i guess i got one of the good ones as i have had no trouble at all .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
did i mention , i can access all my word , excel , and powerpoint files using the google apps .####[('software usability', 'positive')]
unfortunately , this particular computer is 100 % unusable after only 2 years and 2 weeks .####[('laptop usability', 'negative')]
it is a timeless design and a very respectable screen .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
i ' m disappointed with macbook pro 15 ” because sometimes charger macbook pro 15 ” running overheating !####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('power supply operation performance', 'negative')]
apple has always priced their hardware high , but you could always make an argument for the style , nice hardware and the unique osx experience .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('hardware general', 'positive'), ('os general', 'positive'), ('company price', 'negative')]
* extremely weak graphics card .####[('graphics operation performance', 'negative')]
the intel iris sucks .####[('hard disc operation performance', 'negative')]
i can ' t use my printer because it ' s not supported .####[('ports usability', 'negative')]
usb port go dead until i do a restart .####[('ports operation performance', 'negative')]
sometimes they felt a bit half - baked , but i loved the idea , and the keyboard made a world of difference in what you could do with that tablet .####[('keyboard general', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
the funny part is that the customer service people have been great but they have no control to take care of problems .####[('support general', 'positive')]
as others have already reported , the headphone jack produces extremely weak volume , even at max .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
anyhow , within a week , the speakers started crackling annoyingly when watching videos , or playing games .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
unlike other asus laptops i ' ve tried , this unit won the display roulette .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
if i had it to do over , i would not purchase this computer .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
the first issue is that the speakers are on either side of the computer , and you can barely hear them on max volume .####[('multimedia devices design features', 'negative')]
it also had charging problems and got terrible warranty support .####[('power supply general', 'negative'), ('warranty general', 'negative')]
if bluetooth devices worked with this chromebook it would get 5 stars , but this is the least reliable device in regards to bluetooth i have ever owned .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i feel like i bought a decent machine but it ' s unable to handle the ram workload .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i don ' t think that i was adequately prepared for how dark the screen is at its highest brightness in comparison to other devices .####[('display design features', 'negative')]
don ' t get me wrong , the device flips back and forth very well .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
was initially impressed by design but after normal use without any rough handling or dropping of the chromebook , the metal corner tip covering the lcd peels off & warps / bends upwards !####[('hardware quality', 'negative')]
to say i ' m disappointed in this chromebook would be an understatement .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
this computer is really hard to use .####[('laptop usability', 'negative')]
it ' s their policy to only repair not replace .####[('support quality', 'negative')]

games / video apps perform absolutely awfully .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
the machine ' s visible design itself was fine .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
it will not power on anymore after 2 mos of daily use - 4 hours per day .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
using wifi the signal seems to drop , not sure if the wifi adapter needs an update but there are issues .####[('software operation performance', 'negative'), ('out of scope operation performance', 'negative')]
the mouse pad is very touchy , but i use a separate bluetooth mouse anyways .####[('hardware operation performance', 'neutral')]
beautiful screen .####[('display general', 'positive')]
monitor screen is ok , sometimes the contrast is poor but looks better in games .####[('display operation performance', 'neutral'), ('display operation performance', 'negative'), ('display operation performance', 'positive')]

battery life doesn ' t seem to be more than 5 hours , but i expected that going in .####[('battery quality', 'neutral')]
battery charger is super tiny and lightweight , which is an additional advantage vs the 1 lb brick that you have to lug around with the ux501vw .####[('power supply design features', 'positive')]
i just opened it earlier today and my initial impressions is that it is very attractive and very sturdy feeling and i love the screen which non reflective , it ' s very nice not looking into a reflective glossy screen for a change .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
most of the laptop is actually very good , but is held back by a 5400 rpm hdd .####[('hard disc general', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]

love the form factor and the light weight as i often use my laptop while laying down .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
opening it was a little hard but once opened , it ' s easy to add the ram or ssd .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
less than that , for me , the screen looks dull .####[('display quality', 'negative')]
if you ' re mainly on youtube or reading stuff online , this chromebook functions well for that purpose .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the laptop was shipped in what looked like a new case but upon opening it , it appeared used and repackaged .####[('shipping quality', 'negative')]
freezes with red lines across it , froze five times the first afternoon .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]

before the review this package has nice presentation and solid build .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop quality', 'positive')]

the product looks reasonable at this price range .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]

machine is totally unusable during the update .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i received the item after 18 days of ordering .####[('shipping general', 'negative')]
asus has really set a new standard with the c302ca ' s internals and physical design .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('company design features', 'positive')]
similarly the task tray area of the main task bar is on the small side and lends itself to fat - fingering .####[('software design features', 'negative')]
one of the features of chromeos that i find very convenient is the way in which all of your configuration settings are stored in the cloud with your gmail account .####[('os design features', 'positive')]
a big part of this device is its gorgeous aesthetic .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
this is a great device and the $ 450 asking price seems fair .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'neutral')]
this computer was 10 fold what i had expected .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]

love the backlit keyboard .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
can get pretty warm running an intensive android app for a while .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
at least the volume through bluetooth was tolerable .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'neutral')]
after two years , or almost , the worst thing about this machine is lack of printer support .####[('laptop design features', 'negative')]
