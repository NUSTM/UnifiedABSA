october 12 , 2017 - - started having trouble maintaining connection to wifi ( spectrum service ) , but usually after several loops re - entering password , connection would be re - established .####[('ports quality', 'negative')]
now i ' m really bummed that i have a very nice looking chromebook with a beautiful screen that is totally unusable .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative'), ('display operation performance', 'positive')]
i ' ll wait a while until this device gets 4 - 5 stars .####[('laptop operation performance', 'neutral')]
overall , this thing can do very basic stuff , sometimes .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
keyboard key fragile .####[('keyboard quality', 'negative')]
overall , it is not horrible , but i wouldn ' t purchase this model again .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
- screen feels smaller than other of the same size .####[('display design features', 'negative')]
i already returned the first laptop because i had to press extremely hard to get the left click to work .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
it also refuses to charge past 90 % and instantly jumps to 80 % when i unplug it .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
the flip and touchscreen aspects work fine , no problems .####[('hardware operation performance', 'positive')]
it worked properly for less than a week , and the touch screen stopped functioning again .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative'), ('hardware quality', 'negative')]
good display####[('display general', 'positive')]
my understanding is that chromeos is a very light weight so i don ' t know why it lags sometimes with under 10 tabs open and a youtube video playing .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
i tried messing around in the dev mode to adjust the microphone sensitivity but nothing seems to work .####[('multimedia devices general', 'negative')]
microphone is not really working ( you have to basically yell while alsmost touching it with you lips in order for someone else to hear you ) .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
when switching between tablet and laptop mode quickly the screen will blink and turn off for an extended period of time before turning back on .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
called acer support , they were completely useless .####[('support general', 'negative')]

it feels like a tablet / computer for a child since it ' s so bulky and heavy .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
am i just unlucky , or was this a bad batch ?####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
it appears the adapter may still be good as there are a few sparks when plugging into power but the charging light on the laptop does not come on and the battery is not charging .####[('power supply operation performance', 'positive'), ('hardware operation performance', 'negative'), ('battery quality', 'negative'), ('hardware quality', 'negative'), ('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
i will return it .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
it was fully charged and i only turned it on a total of 3 times before the screen went blank .####[('display operation performance', 'neutral'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
the built - in speaker is below average .####[('multimedia devices general', 'negative')]
i will constantly be thinking about how it will probably fall apart in a few moths .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
aside from that , laptop seems fine .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
no backlit keyboard is kinda a bummer but i digress .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
sad that i can ' t return this one .####[('warranty general', 'negative')]
with this asus i ' m experiencing 2 very disappointing issues .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
graphic issues : after opening any page or window with a black or dark color and i go back to a more bright or white page it takes at least 5 good second to gain the full luminosity####[('graphics operation performance', 'negative')]
the m key popped off during initial setup .####[('keyboard quality', 'negative')]
amazon is 2 - day shipping me a replacement .####[('company general', 'neutral')]
camera is sd but not a problem .####[('hardware general', 'neutral')]
back lit keyboard should be a standard by now !####[('keyboard general', 'neutral')]
my friends , both female and male , are going to by this set up for their travel needs but for me it is lacking .####[('laptop usability', 'negative')]
the computer constantly pauses or stutters and then continues when it comes to loading web pages and working on documents .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
the laptop does n ' t work .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
unable to contact asus support for help .####[('support general', 'negative')]
should ' ve stick with my pixelbook which was awesome and never have me trouble .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
no backlighting on the keyboard .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
i would not recommend you buying this laptop , the specs are fine for the price , but the hardware is rubbish .####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('hardware general', 'negative'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
* * returning the device - - that unhappy with the item .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
do not buy it will not search what you type in i want my money back####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
thanks to its ssd , it boots windows 10 pretty fast , bloatware is kept to a minimum ( please uninstall norton before doing anything else .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
oh , and the nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least ( grid autosport fps avg is in the 80s / 90s or so )####[('graphics operation performance', 'positive')]
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####[('laptop price', 'positive'), ('display design features', 'positive')]
- trackpad is too finicky and not my favorite####[('hardware usability', 'negative')]
as of now , for $ 600 or less , this is a nice buy .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
- ips full hd screen .####[('display general', 'neutral')]
best pc bang for this level of buck .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i highly recommend this laptop for anyone looking for a great performing machine with an outstanding price ( just to be clear , it won ' t be running the newest high - end games on ultra - high graphics settings , but it still performs phenomenally for its price range and usage category ) .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
it is also amazingly quiet : the ssd doesn ' t make any noise , and the fan only spins up if i am doing something intensive like playing games or running a heafty program - just browsing or watching videos / basic office work will not make this computer more than whisper .####[('hardware operation performance', 'positive')]
- the backlit keyboard looks nice .####[('keyboard design features', 'positive')]
- windows 10 ( do i really need to list the drawbacks of 10 ?####[('os operation performance', 'negative')]
it ' s lightning fast and handles games like skyrim and the witcher 3 surprisingly smoothly for the price i paid .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
after running good for the initial 25 first days it won ' t power on .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i will painfully learn the new pads .####[('hardware usability', 'negative')]
i ' ve owned several acer monitors that i ' ve always been pleased with , but this is the first computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####[('hard disc design features', 'positive')]
the screen looks great ( though maybe not if all you do is look at 4k resolution ) and the keyboard response feels pretty good .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'positive'), ('display design features', 'positive')]
people said it wasn ' t bright enough but i run at 50 to 75 percent and its white bright .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
for the price , it ' s a solid laptop .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
the keyboard is easy to type on ( and the backlight is an added plus ) .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'positive')]
i added an sd card which has expanded on the 16gb of storage .####[('memory general', 'neutral')]
chromebooks are light weight and start up immediately and are very easy to use .####[('laptop usability', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the keyboard is easy to use , and there is no external noise to contend with .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'positive')]
i use it sort of all day and night and i haven ' t found anything it won ' t do .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the keyboard is nice .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
it ' s absolutely silent .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
first time chrome os user , very streamlined and easy to use .####[('os usability', 'positive')]
it doesn ' t get super loud , but for normal usage situations it ' s fine .####[('laptop operation performance', 'neutral')]
overall , the problems are fairly minor and for the price i ' m happy with what i got .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
it looks nice .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
great price - i always buy the warranty .####[('laptop price', 'positive'), ('warranty general', 'positive')]

it is a good product to buy .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it arrived as promised and was exactly as described .####[('shipping quality', 'positive')]
one of my favorite things i own####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the only problem is that there is no caps lock button on the keyboard .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
i would buy again , especially at this price .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
google docs are getting so good and user friendly who needs office anymore , content accessible anywhere , just takes a little time to get used to but once you realize all the benefits chromebook is a great choice .####[('laptop quality', 'positive'), ('software operation performance', 'positive')]
great cheap tool for web development ( using linux ) and everyday internet usage .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
the only thing is that it does ' t have too much storage room .####[('memory general', 'negative')]
such a perfect little computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
not happy that the l and the quotation mark key no longer work unless i bang on them .####[('keyboard quality', 'negative')]
for the price i think it ' s just fine .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
so far no problems except i tried to print something from my email and am having trouble linking to my printer .####[('laptop connectivity', 'negative')]
we are loving this chromebook !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
this is a great notebook .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]

i love this little chrome book .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
package arrived faster than the estimated arrival .####[('shipping operation performance', 'positive')]

i woudlnt recommend more than 10 active tabs which slows down some of the functionality but otherwise runs smoothly for students####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
battery works well , i get nearly 4 to 5 hours easily .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
this item is excellent and not bad for the price .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
choose this one .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
love this took place of my laptop .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i bought this for a linux machine and it does that just great .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
lenovo has not disappointed with their products .####[('company general', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
2 ) the battery was pretty limited .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
the computer has a solid processor and enough memory to handle pretty much anything the average user willl throw at it , short of graphics - heavy gaming .####[('memory quality', 'positive')]
it is an okay laptop and nothing more .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
beautiful resolution####[('display general', 'positive')]
great item !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
right out of the box , this computer is really slow , but two simple steps easily fix that issue .####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'neutral')]
this is actually the first laptop that fitted all my needs , big clear screen , battery life sucks but this is a power house laptop meant to be in one place since its so big , very good computer replacement , amazing sound and screen and very fast .####[('display design features', 'positive'), ('multimedia devices general', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive'), ('battery operation performance', 'negative')]

you just have to deal with a low battery and that ' s all####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
it is a little slow at times though .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
love this computer !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
pretty fast processor .####[('cpu operation performance', 'positive')]
photoshop also runs very well .####[('software operation performance', 'positive')]
great service with amazon on fulfilling my order .####[('support general', 'positive')]
if you need a decent computer that runs quality this is it , especially if you are starting out .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
love the price reduction and the lenova one year warranty .####[('laptop price', 'positive'), ('warranty general', 'positive')]
it ' s also very lightweight , so it ' s easy to carry around .####[('laptop portability', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive')]
it was easy to set up .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
laptop meets spec for what it was purchased to do but disappointed it was shipped with a charger not compatible with location it was shipped to ( needed to buy an adapter to convert from 2 pin to 3 pin plug )####[('shipping general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
i don ' t really have anywhere to rest my hand when i use it because it ' s so large .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
plenty of memory and storage .####[('memory general', 'positive'), ('hard disc general', 'positive')]
so before you get angry do your homework on why the laptop may be acting strange .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
great computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
that said if you ' re not a computer savvy no worries as soon as you turn it on cortana the computers assistant walks you through everything that you need to do .####[('os general', 'positive')]
also can not just ` ` add ` ` memory ddms : only one socket means you must remove the 8gb and purchace a 16gb ( ~ $ 180 further investment ) ; battery not gon na last several hrs , looking at ~ 2 - 4 .####[('memory general', 'neutral'), ('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
have had mine for about 3 - 4 wks and have had no trouble .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
8g is enough to do most daily activities , i use nvidia geforce now to play much higher end games like destiny 2 , r6 and what not .####[('graphics general', 'neutral')]
great buy .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the only draw back with this pc is the battery life which lasts about 3 hrs before needing to be charged .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
i do like it , just now that i had time to use it in preparing for my exams , the following was observed : -####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
otherwise , it ' s a good computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it ' s pretty fast even with heavy use and multiple applications running at once .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
fantastic computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
for reference : ive had this laptop for about 4 months now for my first year at college .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
youtube works well on here .####[('software operation performance', 'positive')]
easy to use and set up .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
really happy with this laptop !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
price and product , outstanding .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
i like the size but dislike the battery life .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('battery general', 'negative')]
still learning but it ' s a good computer and a great deal####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
when i called they would not accept the serial number .####[('support general', 'negative')]
don ' t buy it .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
i like everything about the device , but the beautiful touchscreen ended up malfunctioning about 6 - months after purchase .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('display design features', 'positive'), ('display quality', 'negative')]
i will see if samsung honors their warrnty , if so , i will probably change / update this review .####[('company general', 'neutral')]
returning it into a standard laptop position did not help , the screen actually turned dark and only closing and opening the lid helped return it to normal state .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this product given the obvious history of quality control issues .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
first and foremost , lets talk about the infamous keyboard .####[('keyboard general', 'negative')]
yes , it ' s absolute garbage .####[('keyboard general', 'negative')]
i ' m surprised people are settling for claiming ` ` it ' s good enough ` ` or ` ` gets the job done ` ` when every time i use it , i ' m constantly reminded of how i should have just sprang for the pixelbook when it was on sale for $ 699 .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
my 2nd issues is with it ' s performance .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
even in the early rounds the frames are heavily compromised and the entire game feels very sluggish .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i haven ' t abused this at all , and i noticed a small crack in the screen today and it ' s starting to spider out .####[('display quality', 'negative')]
i just wanted to make it known my personal experiences with the device .####[('laptop operation performance', 'neutral')]
awesome display .####[('display general', 'positive')]
mouse track pad is non standard .####[('hardware operation performance', 'negative')]
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####[('hardware operation performance', 'negative')]
10 minutes after finishing this review started having a new issue : touch pad started acting out .####[('hardware operation performance', 'negative')]
so one star off for the keyboard .####[('keyboard general', 'negative')]
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .####[('display general', 'positive')]
i really needed this product for work and had big plans for using it ' s features / versatility .####[('laptop operation performance', 'neutral')]
all i got was a fancy 2lb metal slab that can only be used to swat flies .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
sent it in , arrived back in an inadequate box ( i shipped it in the oroginal with protective foam came back in the box from samsung w / o any protection ) and 3 days after i recieved the item back the stylus fell apart .####[('hardware quality', 'negative')]
it fancies itself a convertible notebook / app consuming functional tablet , but it is not .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####[('os usability', 'negative')]
certain apps ( especially flash based apps ) will get the machine very hot .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
it also has much better performance , including an easily upgraded m .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
bought this for someone else , can ' t believe how good it is .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the keys on the keyboard are sunk in a little too low to accommodate for the sleek / thin profile .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
now it kind of feels a little bit like windows but still different .####[('os design features', 'neutral')]
it on the developer channel and have full access to the play store .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
the keyboard is good .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
the battery life has started to go down after a year of solid use ( still quite good ) , but the quality screen and chromeos make it worth it .####[('display quality', 'positive'), ('battery operation performance', 'positive'), ('os quality', 'positive')]
this acer chromebook 14 is by far the best chromebook 300 dollars can buy .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
the build quality is good ( all aluminum body ) .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
the chromebook is quite ideal for those who use their computer mostly for surfing the internet .####[('laptop miscellaneous', 'positive')]
overall , the way i see it , i ' m getting a big screen hd android galaxy tablet with a keyboard for the price of a tablet .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
the keyboard is a delight with large , nearly flush , keys set to just the right level of resistance and sensitivity .####[('keyboard design features', 'positive')]
the base model went up in price $ 400 , which excludes any performance benefits .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
while usb - c is cool , a bag full of dongles is not .####[('ports general', 'positive')]
happy i got a great machine for half the cost !####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
the one i purchased wasn ' t the cheapest but for peace of mind i gladly paid it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
- new radeon graphics card ( finally ! )####[('graphics general', 'positive')]
i thought that it wouldn ' t make any difference , but it does on games####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
that is awesome .####[('hard disc general', 'positive')]
when the computer is working hard , it doesn ' t burn my lap anymore ( although i do feel some hot air flowing through my fingertips , when i am typing , but i am okay with that ) .####[('fans&cooling general', 'positive')]
- ssd ( solid state drive ) is not easily upgradable .####[('hard disc general', 'negative')]
i don ' t like this .####[('ports general', 'negative')]
- the screen is harder to clean .####[('display design features', 'negative')]
in the beginning i felt a little weird about this trackpad .####[('hardware general', 'negative')]
the keyboard is ok .####[('keyboard general', 'neutral')]
the click is now provided by a haptic engine and provides more functionality .####[('hardware design features', 'positive')]
the thing is fantastic .####[('hardware general', 'positive')]
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
i ' m not sure when this feature was introduced , but it is very welcome .####[('software general', 'positive')]
overall , i feel this is the best laptop i ' ve ever purchased or used .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
regardless to the fact that the outside box was damaged , the inside box was fine .####[('shipping general', 'negative'), ('shipping general', 'positive')]
i ' m glad i got this .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
for some of us , even though they are more expensive , they still offer the better value .####[('laptop price', 'negative'), ('laptop quality', 'positive')]
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####[('software general', 'neutral'), ('software operation performance', 'negative')]
i predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 ( frostbyte 3 engine ) that this machine will perform well with the impending starwars battlefront ( also frostbyte 3 ) .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
with the windows 10 / directx 12 improvements , frostbite 3 games will do very well on this machine at 1050p graphics / medium / low with the new starwars game .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
but i fed up with the price it cost to upgrade the product as well as the software .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
computer looked excellent .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
but the mac looked and worked great .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it is a small , light , powerful device that until 2016 seemed custom fit for content creators , photographers , and other such lines of work or hobbies .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
has a long battery life .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
as of now , highly recommended refurbished products####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
well macbook is no less than expected .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
this new generation macbook has a fast processor , great retina display , 13 inch high resolution screen , great compatibility and many more .####[('laptop usability', 'positive'), ('display quality', 'positive'), ('cpu operation performance', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]

wonderful machine fast , clean , solid i have to said that this guy i fell from my hands the first day i use , goes to the floor and nothing happens screen is perfect and nothing is damage !####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
this is my first macbook pro i ' m impress !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
what an excellent computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
as a refurbished item it was indistinguishable from a new item .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
condition even better then i expect .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the mac works like a new one .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it has been great for everything i ' ve done .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
great price for a brand new product .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]

feel totally comfortable with it , and will never go back to a pc .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
this laptop is incredibly lightweight and slim ( ultimately won me over after years of lugging around a whopping 5lb levono ) .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
overall , i ' m very happy i chose this model .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i love it , it is as shown on the picture####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
a great laptop !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
works exactly like it ' s supposed to work !####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
excellent packaging .####[('shipping general', 'positive')]

excellent quality and very fast delivery .####[('laptop quality', 'positive'), ('shipping general', 'positive')]
if you purchase this product , go into it with realistic expectations and patience getting familiar with the setup and you ' ll probably love it , too !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
well , i have to say , i ' m fairly impressed with my new chrome flipbook !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i ' ve used it for 3 days and still have n ' t plugged it in !####[('battery quality', 'positive')]
i feel like this will look good in any decade .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
i boot it up and notice quickly the display seems to be 720p ( or something close ) but for what i need this thing to do .####[('display operation performance', 'neutral')]
` ` this thing is neat . ` `####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
i chose this one mainly because of the full size keyboard , larger screen , and full size hdmi .####[('display design features', 'positive'), ('keyboard design features', 'positive'), ('ports design features', 'positive')]
there nwere complaints regarding the lousy screen resolution , as well as the mouse pad not working well .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'negative'), ('display operation performance', 'negative')]
not sure what the deal is but extremely disappointed .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
the laptop is in great physical conditions , no scratches or anything , but certain actions run slowly , specifically any file read or write , like copying a document , uploading an image , creating a new file , etc .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
the other weird thing is a ` ` popping ` ` noise i keep getting when i use the tracking pad .####[('hardware quality', 'negative')]
it turns out that it ' s not a stain , but the anti - reflective coating coming off .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
ive researched this and it is very common and apple says it ' s normal .####[('support general', 'negative')]
your new retina screen will get stains on it from the top layer seperating and or dead pixels .####[('display quality', 'negative')]
had it for a week now and still finding things it can not do .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
this is a great computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####[('laptop quality', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
lo and behold , i hadn ' t read quite all of the 1 * reviews : the worst was a teacher who had ordered so many for her several classes and said ` ` i think the problem is with the motherboard .####[('motherboard quality', 'negative')]
needless to say , android / play rollout is being managed very , very poorly .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
for the moment , please note - * * * this product no longer works with the google play store in stable or beta * * * and there is no communication about what we can expect , or when .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
- the m3 processor is * plenty * of power for all chrome , video , and android requirements .####[('cpu quality', 'positive')]
but after only a couple of days the thing just turned off and won ' t turn back on again .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
i ' ve had mine 10 months and the motherboard has crapped out twice already .####[('motherboard operation performance', 'negative')]
the build quality is fantastic .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
my disappointment begins with the fact that chromeos is not touch - ready and most websites will not consider touch interface for desktop mode websites .####[('os usability', 'negative')]

the second one arrived , i had it from end of may june , to september started to notice the a key was a bit unresponsive at times .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'negative')]

keeping the msi software is optional , a few of these are useful like burnrecovery to make a backup of your version of windows just in case anything happens .####[('software usability', 'positive'), ('software general', 'neutral')]
keyboard problems too .####[('keyboard general', 'negative')]
msi used to have a driver installer by disk that would install all the proper drivers in the right order , so you ' d have the perfect configuration .####[('software design features', 'positive')]

don ' t recommend it .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]

the laptop itself seemed fine at first .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i left it plugged in to charge for the night and tried it again the next morning , with the same results of not being able to turn it back on .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
i hate to knock acer as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new product and then not being able to turn it on to use it .####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('company general', 'negative')]

keyboard is a bit nicer , not tons .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
this thing is n ' t that fast , but for loading web pages , it ' s pretty close .####[('cpu operation performance', 'positive')]

this laptop performs in every way .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
- the touchscreen is very responsive , fast , and so far everything has scaled just fine during use####[('hardware operation performance', 'positive')]
and because of the constant usage of higher brightness , the battery does drain faster .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
other than my hope that it would be light enough to use as a tablet all the time , this is the chromebook i ' ve been wanting for a long time now .####[('laptop portability', 'negative')]
the design and style is topnotch .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]

sound has been fine , except for a few issues with an android app , and that can easily be software related as android is still in infant stages ( or at least toddler ) on chromebooks , and i expect those quirks will smooth out over time as chromebook software is updated on a very regular basis .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
android is running flawlessly so far , barring one minor incident with sound on clash of clans ( which went away on reboot ) .####[('software operation performance', 'positive')]
fast , beautiful display , comfortable keyboard , and the android apps work well ( not great yet , but well ) .####[('keyboard usability', 'positive'), ('display design features', 'positive'), ('software operation performance', 'positive')]

the pricing was too good to pass up and i ' ve really been pleased with the product .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]

for me the extra storage , back light keyboard ( you ' ll love it ) , 2 in 1 factor , and great build quality made it a no - brainer .####[('laptop quality', 'positive'), ('keyboard general', 'positive'), ('hard disc design features', 'positive')]
- backlit and solid keyboard ( not flimsy or cheap )####[('keyboard design features', 'positive')]
- side buttons are responsive and well - made####[('hardware design features', 'positive'), ('hardware operation performance', 'positive')]
overall , i am happy with it and would purchase it again .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the sound isn ' t great on both devices but they ' ll suffice ; at least the asus speakers are side - firing and not coming from the bottom like the pro .####[('multimedia devices design features', 'positive')]
i don ' t know why google print is so touchy .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
the second is also a known trouble spot with android , and that is the microsd card .####[('out of scope general', 'negative')]
