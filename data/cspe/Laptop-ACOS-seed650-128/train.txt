overall , this thing can do very basic stuff , sometimes .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
i only use the chormebook for surving the internet , checking my email , and watch hulu or netflix .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
the flip and touchscreen aspects work fine , no problems .####[('hardware operation performance', 'positive')]
it can not .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
good looking laptop but hardware has several major problems .####[('hardware general', 'negative'), ('laptop design features', 'positive')]
6 - inch hd touch , intel celeron n3150 , 4gb ddr3l , 32gb , chrome , cb5 - 132t - c1lk####[('memory general', 'neutral')]
not worth it .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
delete and power button too close to each other and looks the same , i accidentally pressed the power button couple of times .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative'), ('keyboard usability', 'negative')]
feel like at max brightness it just isn ' t enough .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
no back light keyboard####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
battery life is only 3 .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
- i swear my screen periodically changes brightness but i can ' t tell if this is my imagination or not .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
- easily upgradeable hdd ( it comes with a 512 ssd , which is fine for now , but is easily changed out )####[('hardware usability', 'positive')]
multiple ports for anything you need .####[('ports general', 'positive')]
great laptop for expansion and upgrade .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
this computer lives up to its expectations .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
was very easy to add memory .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
i have been using a chromebook now for three years and am totally satisfied .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
my old chromebook is an acer and i ' ve had absolutely no problems with it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
if i have a video call going on facebook messenger , chrome will take three or four seconds to respond .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
great price - i always buy the warranty .####[('warranty general', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
excellent for those uses .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
love it !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
priced well .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
i love this little chrome book .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
everything works great .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
bigger screen####[('display general', 'positive')]
this has worked great to overcome that problem .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
love it !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the best laptop for its price .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
this is a great laptop for web browsing , skype , and more simple games .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
laptop meets spec for what it was purchased to do but disappointed it was shipped with a charger not compatible with location it was shipped to ( needed to buy an adapter to convert from 2 pin to 3 pin plug )####[('shipping general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
has ac wireless so you can see the 5ghz on your network , blazing fast .####[('ports operation performance', 'positive')]
i have had no issues with it since i bought it i would highly recommend it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
have had mine for about 3 - 4 wks and have had no trouble .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
if your main priority is a long lasting battery this is n ' t for you .####[('battery general', 'negative')]
it is a very nice computer that serves his needs very well .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it ' s also worth noting my unit came with a floating trackpad , with initial play before the actually click .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
apparently there is some optimizations that google has done with the op1 and pixel that allow what is called instant ink .####[('company operation performance', 'positive')]
horrible , purchased directly from google , dead pixel on arrival , note feature did not pick up stylus and bluetooth rarely worked .####[('hardware general', 'negative'), ('display quality', 'negative'), ('ports operation performance', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'negative')]
chrome os is not matured in any way .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####[('os usability', 'negative')]
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .####[('company general', 'positive')]
the mouse area is responsive , and has a nice feel to it .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'positive')]
hope to continue to get many more years of use out of it !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
beautiful ips display .####[('display design features', 'positive')]
the keyboard is good .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
where they didn ' t sacrifice is on build quality .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
i ' ve kept an eye on chromebooks for the last couple of years as a possible option for a low - cost laptop .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
this acer chromebook 14 is by far the best chromebook 300 dollars can buy .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
it is also very gnu + linux friendly if you want to replace the os entirely .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
i could not be happier with this computer because i am not the best person with technology .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
this acer is a web surfer that ' s easy to travel with .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
sure , another generation back was arguably better , but i find this computer to be adequate to my needs right now ( though it is a disappointment that i can ' t upgrade the ram , which definitely limits the lifetime of how long this product will last ) .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
the overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .####[('os usability', 'positive')]
i ' m probably a bit biased on macs since i ' m a professional graphic designer , and it ' s just the industry standard .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
it boots up instantaneously .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it is a small , light , powerful device that until 2016 seemed custom fit for content creators , photographers , and other such lines of work or hobbies .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
well macbook is no less than expected .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i love this laptop .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i ' ve only had it for one day and the set up was easy , and all items delivered were present , will update over time !####[('os usability', 'positive')]
the display clarity is outstanding .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
works exactly like it ' s supposed to work !####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
fast delivery , brand new as expected .####[('shipping quality', 'positive')]
i was super worried that touching the keyboard when it was in tablet mode would cause it to switch back to laptop mode , but it looks like once you move the screen back past like 180 degrees , it goes into full touchscreen .####[('keyboard usability', 'negative')]
my only complaint is the click on the touchpad feels a little cheap , but i just use ` ` tap to click ` ` so it ' s not an issue .####[('hardware operation performance', 'negative')]
the power button is no longer on the keyboard , but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
transferring files from a non - iphone phone , like android is extremely annoying .####[('software portability', 'negative')]
i made the mistake of thinking it was new .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
paradoxically , this laptop is a ` ` pro ` ` .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####[('laptop quality', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
it charges insanely fast .####[('power supply operation performance', 'positive')]
i ' ll end the review simply saying i ' m very happy overall with my purchase !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
great machine out of the box .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the c302 is a great machine .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i ' ve had mine 10 months and the motherboard has crapped out twice already .####[('motherboard operation performance', 'negative')]
â€¢ super thin and light weight####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
app game ( simpsons tapped out ) ( i know don ' t judge ) lags at every moment .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
i love how i can charge my laptop on both sides of the device .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
10 months in my battery will no longer charge .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
upon further inspection , i had noticed that one of the side speakers was pushed in and the plastic surrounding it had a crack .####[('multimedia devices design features', 'negative')]
i just fear for the long term ruggedness of the exterior .####[('hardware general', 'negative')]
it simply refuses to boot .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
i ' ve never owned an msi laptop and if i can help it , this one is going back and i will never own one again .####[('company general', 'negative')]
keyboard layout is not the best , do not like that i have to press the function key to raise or lower the volume / brightness on the arrow keys .####[('keyboard design features', 'neutral')]
so called msi tech support , went through the troubleshooting and of course they could not fix it .####[('support general', 'negative')]
it ' s a very fast laptop .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it randomly shuts down all programs running and goes back to the desktop like nothing was going on .####[('os operation performance', 'negative')]
this laptop is my first time using the intel optane thing and after this i can not recommend it .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]

it ' s a good system and has loads of space available for storage :####[('os general', 'positive'), ('memory design features', 'positive')]
all in all a great cheap gaming laptop that even with the cons i am not dissatisfied with the product .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
even using it a bit makes my hands / wrist uncomfortable .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'negative')]
this happened 7 times within 20 minutes when i was working on something .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
support got quite unpleasant when i ask about replacement .####[('support quality', 'negative')]
the screen display isn ' t bright at all !####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
will not recommend it .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]

it would not start up after 2 months of purchase and then re - set button didn ' t work .####[('hardware general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'negative')]
after running through the setup wizard , the laptop failed to boot .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
it ' s a good enough laptop .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
with my first day of use everything was terribly slow and updates took hours .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
- android apps and google play store are real game changers for the chromeos landscape .####[('software general', 'positive')]
d ) a bluetooth mouse - while this unarguably has one of the best trackpads in chromebook land , there are still times you just need the precision of a mouse .####[('hardware general', 'positive')]
then the asus flip c302 came into my life :####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
80 % of the apps it ' s a poor experience .####[('software quality', 'negative')]
