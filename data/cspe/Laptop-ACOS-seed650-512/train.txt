i ' ll wait a while until this device gets 4 - 5 stars .####[('laptop operation performance', 'neutral')]
overall , this thing can do very basic stuff , sometimes .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
keyboard key fragile .####[('keyboard quality', 'negative')]
i only use the chormebook for surving the internet , checking my email , and watch hulu or netflix .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
so latest update the charger only last about one year and the half .####[('power supply general', 'negative')]
the flip and touchscreen aspects work fine , no problems .####[('hardware operation performance', 'positive')]
it can not .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
but you can ' t use an acer chromebook r 11 this way .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
we ordered this chromebook for my son to use for school .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
plug - in or usb microphones seem to work fine , so it ' s not a terribly big issue and i don ' t really even use a microphone that often , but it ' s annoying to buy a product and not have it working .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
in addition , in my short time using the device , i realized how much i dislike having fingerprints on my computer screen .####[('out of scope general', 'negative')]
good looking laptop but hardware has several major problems .####[('hardware general', 'negative'), ('laptop design features', 'positive')]
i ' ve called twice to try to connect it to printer , first call they told me i had to get a cloud ready printer after getting said printer it still doesn ' t connect .####[('laptop connectivity', 'negative')]
6 - inch hd touch , intel celeron n3150 , 4gb ddr3l , 32gb , chrome , cb5 - 132t - c1lk####[('memory general', 'neutral')]
i hope it is fixed this time .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
i was very excited at the prospect of buying this laptop .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it appears the adapter may still be good as there are a few sparks when plugging into power but the charging light on the laptop does not come on and the battery is not charging .####[('power supply operation performance', 'positive'), ('hardware operation performance', 'negative'), ('battery quality', 'negative'), ('hardware quality', 'negative'), ('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
not worth it .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
delete and power button too close to each other and looks the same , i accidentally pressed the power button couple of times .####[('keyboard usability', 'negative'), ('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
on day one , i had been using it for maybe 2 hours and it randomly shut off .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
feel like at max brightness it just isn ' t enough .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
i ' m amazed how bad this machine is for the money , and for being described as a ` ` mid - level gamer . ` `####[('laptop price', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'negative')]
no back light keyboard####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
performance is mediocre####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
not only is it light the battery charger is tiny and with the thin bezels this is a super compact design .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop portability', 'positive'), ('power supply design features', 'positive')]
i am sure amazon will exchange it again but it is not worth the time and hassle .####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('company general', 'neutral')]
the speakers are also not great and the max volume on watching netflix or other videos is rather quite .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
the laptop does n ' t work .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
battery life is only 3 .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
* * returning the device - - that unhappy with the item .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
i will be returning this item .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
it will however win with substance .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price )####[('laptop price', 'positive'), ('display design features', 'positive')]
- the battery life is at least 8 hours .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
- i swear my screen periodically changes brightness but i can ' t tell if this is my imagination or not .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
- easily upgradeable hdd ( it comes with a 512 ssd , which is fine for now , but is easily changed out )####[('hardware usability', 'positive')]
multiple ports for anything you need .####[('ports general', 'positive')]
decent sized track pad .####[('hardware design features', 'positive')]
it cost 8 dollars and shipping is not cheap .####[('shipping price', 'negative')]
taking off the entire back of the laptop is very difficult .####[('hardware design features', 'negative')]
i should also mention that i got this laptop when it was 100 dollars off .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
great laptop for expansion and upgrade .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
this computer lives up to its expectations .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
people said it wasn ' t bright enough but i run at 50 to 75 percent and its white bright .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
was very easy to add memory .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
hope this review can save others from the initial hassle i endured because the chromebook 3 looks terrific in any other way .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i have been using a chromebook now for three years and am totally satisfied .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
my old chromebook is an acer and i ' ve had absolutely no problems with it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
this samsung works as expected and is a good , basic chromebook .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it is fantastic for the things that i need a computer for .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it ' s absolutely silent .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
no fans grinding away .####[('fans&cooling quality', 'positive')]
i ' ve inadvertently had more than a dozen youtube videos playing at the same time and it was sort of noisy but it wasn ' t lagging .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
the only program i couldn ' t find a cloud solution for was scrivener .####[('software usability', 'neutral')]
( * cough ' quizlet ' cough * ) i use this hooked up to my mobile hotspot from my cell phone mainly , and it allows me access anywhere i have cell service .####[('laptop connectivity', 'positive')]
, as it doesn ' t have large built in memory .####[('memory design features', 'negative')]
if i have a video call going on facebook messenger , chrome will take three or four seconds to respond .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
once you get accustomed to the interface , you realize they do everything you need .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
great price - i always buy the warranty .####[('laptop price', 'positive'), ('warranty general', 'positive')]
excellent for those uses .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
google is amazing .####[('company general', 'positive')]
i ' m using this device to run a small etsy business and its perfect for my needs .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
one of my favorite things i own####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i was very surprised at how fast it came .####[('shipping operation performance', 'positive')]
although lightweight and less expensive , the lack of sensitivity of the touchpad makes using this with ease kind of frustrating .####[('laptop usability', 'positive'), ('keyboard operation performance', 'negative'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
it is very helpful and it is very fast .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
the battery will last a full day or two so it ' s very good for a middle school student .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
such a perfect little computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
original order arrived with damaged screen ; however , i contacted amazon and 2 days later i had the replacement .####[('support quality', 'positive'), ('display quality', 'negative')]
it works great for what i need .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
for the price i think it ' s just fine .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
i bought this for a light user and it seems like the chrome os is going to work well for her - simple and quick .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
i ' m satisfied with the product .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
love it !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
very satisfied with simplicity of use , the streamlining of the google products , and the considerable battery life .####[('laptop usability', 'positive'), ('battery operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive')]

i love this little chrome book .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
package arrived faster than the estimated arrival .####[('shipping operation performance', 'positive')]
everything works great .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]

i bought this for a linux machine and it does that just great .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
i love this one !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i am very happy with this item .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
bigger screen####[('display general', 'positive')]
the battery capacity is 3 hours on a full charge####[('battery quality', 'negative')]
this has worked great to overcome that problem .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
great amount of memory for a small business .####[('memory general', 'positive')]
excellent lapto , just as they show it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it is very good to use in korea .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]

the best laptop for its price .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
lenovo computers are of chinese manufacture and thus you will not know if yours is one of the pla ' s cyber - spies .####[('company general', 'neutral')]
i ' ve had this laptop for 4 months and it ' s run very well considering it ' s price .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
only issue is that the graphics aren ' t quite as good as i expected , but i didn ' t buy this to use as a gaming pc so i ' m not overly concerned about it .####[('graphics operation performance', 'neutral')]
this is a great laptop for web browsing , skype , and more simple games .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it ' s been about 3 weeks since my purchase of my lenova laptop and figure it ' s time to give my all important review .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
it ' s also very lightweight , so it ' s easy to carry around .####[('laptop portability', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive')]
i love the fact that it can extend and be flat .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
cons : i wished it had a backlight on the keyboard .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
lenovo should put a better battery in it , and should make a retrofit available .####[('company design features', 'negative')]
lenovo paid for my shipping to the repair facility since i ' d had it such a short time , and they fixed and returned it in a reasonable time period .####[('support operation performance', 'positive')]
it works like it is made to run linux .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it was easy to set up .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
laptop meets spec for what it was purchased to do but disappointed it was shipped with a charger not compatible with location it was shipped to ( needed to buy an adapter to convert from 2 pin to 3 pin plug )####[('shipping general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
i don ' t really have anywhere to rest my hand when i use it because it ' s so large .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
otherwise i really do love it####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
keyboard is pretty damn good and the track pad is fair .####[('keyboard general', 'positive'), ('hardware general', 'positive')]
has ac wireless so you can see the 5ghz on your network , blazing fast .####[('ports operation performance', 'positive')]
great laptop if you are willing to put in an ssd and reinstall windows .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it is very easy to use the set up was awesome .####[('software usability', 'positive')]
i have had no issues with it since i bought it i would highly recommend it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
have had mine for about 3 - 4 wks and have had no trouble .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
if your main priority is a long lasting battery this is n ' t for you .####[('battery general', 'negative')]
it is a very nice computer that serves his needs very well .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
haven ' t had it long so only 4 stars but if it holds up it ' s worth 5 .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i would buy this for myself as well .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i wish the camera was a little better , but it ' s great otherwise .####[('multimedia devices general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
i use this laptop for work .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
it ' s pretty fast even with heavy use and multiple applications running at once .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it ' s not real fast and it doesn ' t have a lot of storage .####[('hard disc general', 'negative'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
the only problem that i have found about lenovo is that it comes with a program called migration , which is supposed to migrate your things from your old computer to your new computer .####[('software design features', 'negative')]
i enjoy that it has 10 key .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
for reference : ive had this laptop for about 4 months now for my first year at college .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
really happy with this laptop !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i have yet to update the drives on it or try a game but so far its a good machine .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
very good purchase .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
price and product , outstanding .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
great laptop , very quick and efficient for work and casual gaming , got over 200 fps for steam games .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
the solution i am trying for now is to disable the touch screen .####[('display quality', 'neutral')]
if you are wanting a beautiful screen that beats all other tablets for color range and matches samsung ' s galaxy tab s3 ( top android tablet ) , but if you absolutely must have a keyboard , don ' t buy this .####[('keyboard general', 'negative'), ('display design features', 'positive')]
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
to make things worse , i currently live overseas and am highly doubtful that samsung would do anything about this , given that it was bought in the us .####[('support operation performance', 'negative')]
in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this product given the obvious history of quality control issues .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
i ' m surprised people are settling for claiming ` ` it ' s good enough ` ` or ` ` gets the job done ` ` when every time i use it , i ' m constantly reminded of how i should have just sprang for the pixelbook when it was on sale for $ 699 .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
my 2nd issues is with it ' s performance .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
it ' s also worth noting my unit came with a floating trackpad , with initial play before the actually click .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
possible note , it was very light .####[('laptop portability', 'positive')]
while this thing is gorgeous and the perfect size for what i was looking for , my initial display died after not even 12 hours of use .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
it is very limited and the competition for an actual usable operating system that can do a lot more than just browse the internet , are available .####[('os operation performance', 'negative'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####[('keyboard general', 'negative'), ('laptop design features', 'negative')]
this is quite honest , a very expensive chrome browser .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
i do not recommend it at this price point .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
after a couple of weeks i started experiencing web browsing issues .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
first occasionally and later to a point where the laptop became unusable .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####[('hardware operation performance', 'negative')]
i went in to this purchase assuming that the availability of android apps from the google play store would make this unit into a true windows alternative .####[('software usability', 'negative')]
so one star off for the keyboard .####[('keyboard general', 'negative')]
needless to say , if you thought this capability would allow you to use a browser other than chrome , forget it .####[('os operation performance', 'negative')]
the problem is that it never charged .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i really needed this product for work and had big plans for using it ' s features / versatility .####[('laptop operation performance', 'neutral')]
apparently there is some optimizations that google has done with the op1 and pixel that allow what is called instant ink .####[('company operation performance', 'positive')]
i have also noticed the pro seems to run hotter and have a noticeably shorter battery life .####[('fans&cooling operation performance', 'negative'), ('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
horrible , purchased directly from google , dead pixel on arrival , note feature did not pick up stylus and bluetooth rarely worked .####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('hardware general', 'negative'), ('ports operation performance', 'negative'), ('display quality', 'negative')]
samsung makes garbage and treats their customers with no respect .####[('company general', 'negative')]
chrome os is not matured in any way .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####[('os usability', 'negative')]
it is solid , and does a decent job rendering pages , and paired with the extra ram here , it adequately handles streaming content in the background - such as youtube or spotify - and still maintains a decent browsing experience across eight to ten additional tabs ;####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .####[('company general', 'positive')]
the hardware specs on this are very nice compared to other offerings : 4g ram , 32g storage , quad - core processor , etc .####[('hardware general', 'positive')]
the mouse area is responsive , and has a nice feel to it .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'positive')]
the overall unit has a slim profile , and is light weight .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
i think biggest reason i like it is that it ' s sturdy and i don ' t mind throwing it in and out of my backpack whereas with a $ 1000 mb air i might be a whole lot more careful in how i handle it .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
hope to continue to get many more years of use out of it !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
since i already do all of my work in google drive , this is perfect for me .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it take a bit of getting used to .####[('keyboard usability', 'neutral')]
beautiful ips display .####[('display design features', 'positive')]
i ' m running it at 2500x1400 resolution extremely thin and lightweight .####[('display design features', 'positive')]
now it kind of feels a little bit like windows but still different .####[('os design features', 'neutral')]
one thing keeps it from getting a five - star rave from me .####[('laptop design features', 'negative')]
the keyboard is good .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
but the 4 gb of ram makes the things you use a chromebook for work without delay .####[('memory operation performance', 'positive')]
where they didn ' t sacrifice is on build quality .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
i ' ve kept an eye on chromebooks for the last couple of years as a possible option for a low - cost laptop .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
with a solid cpu and 4gb of memory i can run a dozen or more open tabs with good performance .####[('cpu operation performance', 'positive'), ('memory operation performance', 'positive')]
this acer chromebook 14 is by far the best chromebook 300 dollars can buy .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
it is also very gnu + linux friendly if you want to replace the os entirely .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
i could not be happier with this computer because i am not the best person with technology .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
first time users might have a hard time using the keyboard ( some keys like caps lock , pagedown , pageup , delete , home etc are missing , browse the internet to get the equivalent ones ) .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative')]
the build quality is good ( all aluminum body ) .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
the boot up is fast .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
as for actual device it is completely gorgeous and ( now ) works flawlessly .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
this acer is a web surfer that ' s easy to travel with .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
i purchased this item 7 months ago and i love it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the only thing i did not like about the design is the fact that the speakers are on the bottom of the unit .####[('multimedia devices design features', 'negative')]
with real function keys , i don ' t worry about one vendor or another not upgrading fast enough and losing virtual function keys , so this model is golden .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i thought that it wouldn ' t make any difference , but it does on games####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
- the computer is 1 pound ( approx .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
battery life : i haven ' t had the laptop for too long but easily get 8 hours or more on a charge .####[('battery general', 'positive')]
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
sure , another generation back was arguably better , but i find this computer to be adequate to my needs right now ( though it is a disappointment that i can ' t upgrade the ram , which definitely limits the lifetime of how long this product will last ) .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
the overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
the force touch trackpad works great .####[('hardware general', 'positive')]
and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .####[('os usability', 'positive')]
i ' m probably a bit biased on macs since i ' m a professional graphic designer , and it ' s just the industry standard .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
fantastic computer !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the mbp does not run as hot as my old white mb did .####[('laptop quality', 'neutral')]
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####[('software general', 'neutral'), ('software operation performance', 'negative')]
but the mac looked and worked great .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it boots up instantaneously .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it is a small , light , powerful device that until 2016 seemed custom fit for content creators , photographers , and other such lines of work or hobbies .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
the new retina is amazing and the speed is awesome .####[('cpu operation performance', 'positive'), ('display operation performance', 'positive')]
well macbook is no less than expected .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i love this laptop .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
wonderful machine fast , clean , solid i have to said that this guy i fell from my hands the first day i use , goes to the floor and nothing happens screen is perfect and nothing is damage !####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
condition even better then i expect .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
now i keep seeing headlines for bad battery life and other woes for the 2016 edition and feel extra satisfied by my choice .####[('battery quality', 'negative')]
it ' s a great computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
1 - itunes match ( $ 25 / yr i believe ) keeps all of your music synced across all of your ios devices with no limit .####[('software general', 'positive')]
i ' ve only had it for one day and the set up was easy , and all items delivered were present , will update over time !####[('os usability', 'positive')]
the display clarity is outstanding .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
works exactly like it ' s supposed to work !####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
love my macbook , beautiful and use daily !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
this is a lovely product that i recommend for general use as a student , less so for gaming and storing whatnot .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i love it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
fast delivery , brand new as expected .####[('shipping quality', 'positive')]
i was super worried that touching the keyboard when it was in tablet mode would cause it to switch back to laptop mode , but it looks like once you move the screen back past like 180 degrees , it goes into full touchscreen .####[('keyboard usability', 'negative')]
i also bought a wireless mouse , which paired perfectly .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
well , i have to say , i ' m fairly impressed with my new chrome flipbook !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i ' ve used it for 3 days and still have n ' t plugged it in !####[('battery quality', 'positive')]
it ' s fast , secure , easy to use ( even as a tech geek , it ' s nice knowing something ' s just going to work ) .####[('laptop usability', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
my only complaint is the click on the touchpad feels a little cheap , but i just use ` ` tap to click ` ` so it ' s not an issue .####[('hardware operation performance', 'negative')]
all of it feels very strudy ( within reason ) and has a nice , modern look and feel to it .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
buy it for school , buy it for home , buy on for the grandkids .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i chose this one mainly because of the full size keyboard , larger screen , and full size hdmi .####[('display design features', 'positive'), ('keyboard design features', 'positive'), ('ports design features', 'positive')]
yes , this chromebook comes with the android app store pre - installed .####[('laptop design features', 'neutral')]
although 4 gigs of ram doesn ' t seem like a lot to some of us , because of the simple software , it is very fast with no lag .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('software design features', 'positive'), ('memory quality', 'neutral')]
the power button is no longer on the keyboard , but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
this machine , through her minimum time of using it , has already been so much faster for her to use .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
this by far has been the easiest to set up and use .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
it is fast and simple .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
this model has a defect .####[('laptop design features', 'negative')]
the laptop is in great physical conditions , no scratches or anything , but certain actions run slowly , specifically any file read or write , like copying a document , uploading an image , creating a new file , etc .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i bought this to save me money and now i wasted $ 700 to still have to go out and buy a new one .####[('laptop quality', 'negative'), ('laptop price', 'negative')]
as soon as i turned on the computer , it froze as i tried to sync information .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
unfortunately this macbook is part of the ` ` staingate ` ` series , i would not suggest to buy this as apple doesn ' t seem to care about customers buying a faulty product that is very expensive####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('laptop price', 'negative'), ('company quality', 'negative')]
have not heard any complaints about the product .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
disappointed in reliability : used in a small business operated by my wife .####[('laptop usability', 'negative')]
it turns out that it ' s not a stain , but the anti - reflective coating coming off .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
great aesthetics .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
transferring files from a non - iphone phone , like android is extremely annoying .####[('software portability', 'negative')]
the quality is terrible ( both versions ) for such a pricey product .####[('laptop quality', 'negative'), ('laptop price', 'negative')]
this is not a new unit .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
i made the mistake of thinking it was new .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
it would power on , start to boot , then abruptly power down .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
* decent selection of ports for its size####[('ports design features', 'positive')]
paradoxically , this laptop is a ` ` pro ` ` .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
this is a great computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
beware that stains in the coating of the display have been detected in all of the macbook retina editions .####[('display quality', 'negative')]
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .####[('laptop quality', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
my second asus chromebook has died .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
most apps run pretty - ok in beta - some problems i ' m noticing in beta are that bluetooth is less than ideal and i believe battery life suffers greatly , now that i ' ve been paying attention to it .####[('ports general', 'negative'), ('battery quality', 'negative'), ('software operation performance', 'positive')]
i ' m still loving the * idea * of what the c302 is supposed to be , but the execution is feeling more and more of a miss .####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
i will update this review when there is further progress - i believe this is a 5 star product but the updates are reducing my confidence in the software .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('software general', 'neutral')]
it charges insanely fast .####[('power supply operation performance', 'positive')]
i ' ll end the review simply saying i ' m very happy overall with my purchase !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
great machine out of the box .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the c302 is a great machine .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i ' ve had mine 10 months and the motherboard has crapped out twice already .####[('motherboard operation performance', 'negative')]
my disappointment begins with the fact that chromeos is not touch - ready and most websites will not consider touch interface for desktop mode websites .####[('os usability', 'negative')]
• super thin and light weight####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
at first i was totally stoked on this chromebook .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i would look elsewhere for a convertible chrombook , this one just doesn ' t quite live up expectactions .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
the machine is easy to use , snappy , and everything the reviewers say .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
so be forwarded , if you buy this , you are jumping right into a machine that won ' t get updates anymore ( which is something most chromebook owners want and a feature that makes them better than android and it ' s fragmented market ) .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
many apps won ' t download and work on it like they do on an ellipsis .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
this is not an inexpensive product , especially for a chrome book but , i figured you get what you pay for .####[('laptop price', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
the one star is for warranty support .####[('support general', 'positive')]
- i love the chromebook overall####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
works great as a chromebook but chromebooks are still very limited for android compatibility , at least this one is .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop usability', 'negative')]
however , for using it as a tablet / computer with streaming , it seems to only work half the time .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
netflix and hulu seem to be working for the most part so far , but amazon prime and xfinity stream are both having issues .####[('software operation performance', 'negative'), ('software operation performance', 'neutral')]
the computer is great , but the charger is garbage .####[('power supply general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
they just don ' t get loud enough and that ' s crucial for me since i watch a lot of youtube and listen to music while doing other things on the machine .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
the sound and screen quality is low .####[('multimedia devices quality', 'negative'), ('display quality', 'negative')]
the computer is nice , blah blah it has nice features but it stops working after a few months .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
this was a splurge for myself , which i rarely do , and i ' m so disappointed that it turned out like this .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
app game ( simpsons tapped out ) ( i know don ' t judge ) lags at every moment .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
the chromebook seems to be working fine now and my daughter does love it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
however , the speakers are already starting to crackle , and i haven ' t even had the thing for a week .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
moreover i ' m quite upset because it seems amazon will not pay me back the shipping fees , which for me amount to about 100 $ as i live in france .####[('shipping general', 'negative')]
it also has a great backlit keyboard .####[('keyboard design features', 'positive')]
i love how i can charge my laptop on both sides of the device .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
i much suspect that google ' s half baked sustem is at fault .####[('os general', 'negative')]
10 months in my battery will no longer charge .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
this product is built well , but it won ' t run the one android app i hoped it would run , and for whatever reason the app and os update download speeds are abysmal .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
upon further inspection , i had noticed that one of the side speakers was pushed in and the plastic surrounding it had a crack .####[('multimedia devices design features', 'negative')]
only three months in , and the laptop won ' t charge .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
something wrong with the battery .####[('battery quality', 'negative')]
i loved this chromebook but i had to return it bevause it had sound issues .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
chromebooks are a waste of time / money .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
so disappointing to receive the laptop and it wouldn ' t even power up .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
video playback is poor with the amazon prime video player .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
i just fear for the long term ruggedness of the exterior .####[('hardware general', 'negative')]
the screen is good , the tablet mode is nice , and the keyboard has a good feel .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('keyboard design features', 'positive'), ('display general', 'positive')]
first one i received , the space bar got stuck and returned it for a replacement .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'negative')]
screen is good .####[('display general', 'positive')]
it is not up to my expectations , it produces some kind of sound when you play something on youtube ( from its keyboard ) perhaps !####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
this is the worst computer i have ever owned .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
then tonight ( april 29th ) my daughter says it ' s not charging .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]

i updated the realtek audio drivers and tested it using razer surround ' s audio drivers ; it still did not fix it .####[('software general', 'negative')]
i had previouslu bought an msi mobo which refused to boot unless windows 10 was the os , but i had worked around all of those problems .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
it simply refuses to boot .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
it is apparent the hard drive has failed yet again .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
i ' ve never owned an msi laptop and if i can help it , this one is going back and i will never own one again .####[('company general', 'negative')]
msi used to have a driver installer by disk that would install all the proper drivers in the right order , so you ' d have the perfect configuration .####[('software design features', 'positive')]
im actually wondering if there is an issue with the speakers , it ' s so bad .####[('multimedia devices general', 'negative')]
the unit is whisper quiet and hasn ' t gotten hot no matter how hard i push it .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the ssd is not work after 4 month####[('hard disc quality', 'negative')]
however , i tried to power it up today and kept receiving an error message right at startup that was a ` ` system boot violation ` ` .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
the responses in the faq are wrong , this does not have 16 gb of ram , almost gave it a 1 star bexause of this reason .####[('support general', 'negative')]
keyboard layout is not the best , do not like that i have to press the function key to raise or lower the volume / brightness on the arrow keys .####[('keyboard design features', 'neutral')]
in essence , if you want a gaming pc , this one will do the job .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
this laptop is actually horrible .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
everything about the experience has been terrible .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
the last straw happened recently when i put it to sleep and it just wouldn ' t wake up - or rather it would try , and then spend the next several hours in a repair / analyzing mode that didn ' t actually do anything .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
do not buy this computer !####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
multiple system crashes .####[('os operation performance', 'negative')]

eventually it bricked and died 3 days after any possible refund could be made .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
it ' s a very fast laptop .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
i use it for gaming and it runs rocket league at max graphics and it looks amazing !####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it randomly shuts down all programs running and goes back to the desktop like nothing was going on .####[('os operation performance', 'negative')]
only been using it for about a week , continuously getting the error that it can not connect to speakers .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
this laptop is my first time using the intel optane thing and after this i can not recommend it .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]

update review : having had this laptop for a few months it has had a bad crash from a recent windows update .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
for $ 499 the laptop is a bargain , but you should only buy if you you plan to add an ssd in the near future .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
no backlit keyboard####[('keyboard general', 'negative')]
not only is it a hdd , but its a slow one .####[('hard disc operation performance', 'negative')]
the ram is expandable ; i bought 8 gb additional and installed myself fairly easily .####[('memory design features', 'positive')]
it is fast and lightweight .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it ' s a good system and has loads of space available for storage :####[('os general', 'positive'), ('memory design features', 'positive')]
all in all a great cheap gaming laptop that even with the cons i am not dissatisfied with the product .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i like this laptop , for a 15 ` ` monitor laptop with i5 - 8250u cpu , the weight is acceptable for me to carry it to work between different office .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
awesome computer .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it ' s completely quiet , no heat whatsoever , and very fast !####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
well , wifi worked instantly without bugs .####[('ports operation performance', 'positive')]
on the flip side , this asus is very fast with minimal bloatware that is easy to get rid of .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
this is a decent laptop no thanks to asus support .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i bought the computer on january 2018 and so far i am really enjoying it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
after that , it ' s actually been running well .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
everything is amazing , love the look and everything about it until now .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
the keyboard is okay .####[('keyboard general', 'neutral')]
most of the time it works very well and one is subject to the vagaries of the various apps , browser , etc .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
it ' s easy find and delete pics and files you ' ve downloaded .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
even using it a bit makes my hands / wrist uncomfortable .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'negative')]
this happened 7 times within 20 minutes when i was working on something .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
unfortunately this chromebook is very sluggish .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
next day during a video froze and just kept looping one section as it froze , and then froze and made a horrible loud scratching noise .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
support got quite unpleasant when i ask about replacement .####[('support quality', 'negative')]
i ' ve had it for less than two months it randomly shuts down .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
very good build quality , except for the keyboard apparently , sound was very big , very fast boot times and so much more .####[('os operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop quality', 'positive'), ('keyboard quality', 'negative'), ('multimedia devices operation performance', 'positive')]
the screen display isn ' t bright at all !####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
update - this thing frustrated me so much over the past month that i just threw it in the trash ( where it belongs ) .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
it started to get slow a week ago .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
if you use wix to edit websites the scroll bar will not appear once you enter editor page , thus making it impossible to design / build / update websites .####[('software usability', 'negative')]
i was disappointed with the touch pad would stick and when it broke loose it over shot the target .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'negative')]
do not buy this machine if you ' re hoping to run android apps .####[('laptop usability', 'negative')]
will not recommend it .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
my computer was used on average a couple hours a day .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
first one had a white line on the screen , then went and got a replacement , not even six months into this one and the graphics card failed .####[('graphics general', 'negative'), ('display operation performance', 'negative')]
laptop failed after only six months of use .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
worked fine until 3 months after i bought it .####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
it would not start up after 2 months of purchase and then re - set button didn ' t work .####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('hardware general', 'negative')]
its a good computer for the price but it needs to work awhile without crashing within 6 months .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
at this point i no longer trusted this model and was afraid of having the same issue with a replacement if i exchanged it , and then not having enough time to do another exchange and still be able to charge and configure it in time to wrap and put under the christmas tree for my son , so i contacted amazon and they gladly e - mailed me a return shipping label and refunded my money in full in 3 days , after receiving it back from me .####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('support general', 'positive')]
i hate to knock acer as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new product and then not being able to turn it on to use it .####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('company general', 'negative')]
twice in 10 days i had an issue , pointer , where they said turn it over and put a pin in it .####[('out of scope operation performance', 'negative')]
it ' s far too early in this machine ' s life to be encountering problems , the company has very poor customer service , and i would strongly recommend against purchasing .####[('company general', 'negative')]
it works well , but the only thing i don ' t like about it is that it makes it extremely difficult to find things that i ' m looking for .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop usability', 'negative')]
barely have it for 6 months and everything ' s going haywire .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
battery is not as long####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
could have been a great computer if not for the terrible keyboard construction .####[('laptop general', 'positive'), ('keyboard quality', 'negative')]
about 4 hours of battery####[('battery operation performance', 'neutral')]
the fingerprint sensor is a nice touch and the color and feel of the laptop material is also nice .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('hardware operation performance', 'positive')]
15 ` ` screen , full sized keyboard and speed fast enough for some low quality games such as lol .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive'), ('keyboard design features', 'positive')]
this is a painfully slow computer .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
- screen looks good####[('display design features', 'positive')]
after running through the setup wizard , the laptop failed to boot .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
though it is competitively priced for the specs , the laptop felt cheap .####[('laptop quality', 'negative'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]
they are clearly working with more than one person at a time , and not effective multi - taskers .####[('support general', 'negative')]
- excellent cpu####[('cpu general', 'positive')]
- the hard drive is really slow and really loud .####[('hard disc operation performance', 'negative')]
it ' s a good enough laptop .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
with my first day of use everything was terribly slow and updates took hours .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
2 stars taken for horrible sound quality####[('multimedia devices quality', 'negative')]
this computer completely shut down after 2 months .####[('laptop quality', 'negative')]
the only issue i ' m having is battery life .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
the battery broke after just 4 months from baying it am so disappointed with the product####[('laptop general', 'negative'), ('battery quality', 'negative')]
it has a glassy - smooth surface that resists finger - prints and goop , is very large , and has a firm but not too - clunky feeling click to it .####[('display design features', 'positive')]
finally , there are the ports .####[('ports general', 'negative')]
- port minimalism .####[('ports portability', 'negative')]
- clean and secure operating system that is very lean and gets the most out of the systems modest specs####[('os design features', 'positive')]
- android apps and google play store are real game changers for the chromeos landscape .####[('software general', 'positive')]
- system settings could be more robust and better organized####[('os design features', 'neutral')]
d ) a bluetooth mouse - while this unarguably has one of the best trackpads in chromebook land , there are still times you just need the precision of a mouse .####[('hardware general', 'positive')]
this is among the best .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it ' s much smoother with web pages and android apps , and the touch screen is more responsive .####[('display operation performance', 'positive'), ('software operation performance', 'positive')]
then the asus flip c302 came into my life :####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
80 % of the apps it ' s a poor experience .####[('software quality', 'negative')]
the asus c302 is the best chromebook you can buy .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the touch screen is super responsive and the keyboard is excellent .####[('display operation performance', 'positive'), ('keyboard general', 'positive')]
i mostly use it for playing a couple of games , surfing the web , managing my calendar / tasks lists , reading e - books , that sort of thing .####[('laptop operation performance', 'neutral')]
and because of the constant usage of higher brightness , the battery does drain faster .####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
one , the display is gorgeous ; watching video is a treat .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
my use experience has been riddled with lag and jitteriness , although using the touchscreen for a moment sorts everything out .####[('hardware operation performance', 'positive')]
the speakers get plenty loud , but they start to sound pretty bad when turned up a little past half volume .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative'), ('multimedia devices operation performance', 'positive')]
the core m3 allows this system to get fast and to stay quiet .####[('cpu operation performance', 'positive')]
boot up is of course , almost instant .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
- excellent keyboard in all aspects - feel , rigidity , and backlight####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
- my only real gripe is that i wish it was .####[('laptop design features', 'negative')]
other than my hope that it would be light enough to use as a tablet all the time , this is the chromebook i ' ve been wanting for a long time now .####[('laptop portability', 'negative')]
boot speed : likewise , very fast -####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
- the aluminum build is firm and solid without feeling cheap .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
- speakers can ` ` chatter ` ` after playing youtube videos for a long period of time .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative')]
this is smart looking , thin , light weight , and portable .####[('laptop portability', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive')]
- the keyboard is great and has a nice gentle / quiet click to it .####[('keyboard usability', 'positive'), ('keyboard general', 'positive')]
- the build quality is great but not necessarily impressive .####[('laptop quality', 'negative'), ('laptop quality', 'positive')]
i wish the display was able to go about 1 or 2 clicks brighter and about 1 click darker at the lowest setting .####[('display design features', 'negative')]
that said just buy it with confidence , it ' s a top quality product all around , and , it looks and feels that way .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
surprisingly to me , the tablet form has been better than expected for reading .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
in laptop mode the trackpad works very well for this .####[('hardware operation performance', 'positive')]
keybooard : keyboard is good .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
the build quality is great .####[('laptop quality', 'positive')]
bluetooth to an external speaker is do - able , but not convenient .####[('multimedia devices connectivity', 'negative')]
love the keyboard more than its predecessor .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
- backlit keyboard that ' s really quiet ( perfect for in - class typing or library use )####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
i don ' t know that i would want to use for work but it ' s perfect for personal use .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the keyboard is really nice - .####[('keyboard general', 'positive')]
this chromebook is great system that is lightweight , has excellent battery life , and offers a fantastic keyboard .####[('battery general', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive'), ('keyboard general', 'positive')]
the 100gb google drive offer is great , too .####[('software general', 'positive')]
i ' m more about personality than looks , but this little thing is a looker , too .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
touch screen is really responsive .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
the color of everything is so very much brighter and clearer it makes the extra cost is worth more for just that .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
everything works fast and smooth .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
bought this because of the touch screen and specs capable of running android ( and it ' s a supported model ) .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
as a chrome book it is excellent , but android support is unsatisfying .####[('software general', 'negative'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
the tablet here works well .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the touchscreen works well , the apps generally work , the performance is good .####[('display operation performance', 'positive'), ('software operation performance', 'positive')]
i absolutely love this chromebook .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
looks great .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
the screen is a little smaller , but it ' s touch and even higher resolution .####[('display design features', 'positive'), ('display design features', 'neutral')]
it starts up fast .####[('os operation performance', 'positive')]
i work with an it company and we ' re testing an all android environment and it ' s working out pretty well so far .####[('software operation performance', 'positive')]
the only thing i think that could be better is the volume of the speakers .####[('multimedia devices general', 'negative')]
the m3 is great , never slow or laggy .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the computer itself is sturdy and feels well - made , though the keyboard is a bit smaller than i ' m used to .####[('keyboard design features', 'negative'), ('laptop design features', 'positive')]
battery life is good .####[('battery general', 'positive')]
the overall device is slim and lightweight .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
battery life is fantastic giving me over 8 hours easily with moderate usage .####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
touch screen and zoom is great .####[('hardware general', 'positive')]
easy to setup and use####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
i ' ve been happy with all of the asus devices i ' ve purchased ( several computers and tablets ) but this is a real gem .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the good news is that the android features ( google play store apps ) work nearly across the board .####[('software operation performance', 'positive')]
it served my needs of web browsing and word processing for a number of years , but its battery life had dwindled and neither the screen nor the processor can match this asus .####[('display general', 'negative'), ('cpu general', 'negative'), ('battery general', 'negative')]
lightweight , gorgeous , great screen / picture quaity , sound could be louder but still good , fast processor ( i do a lot of research , photo processing , netflix watching and reading on the laptop ) .####[('cpu operation performance', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('multimedia devices general', 'positive')]
the touchscreen is great though and feels very intuitive .####[('display general', 'positive')]
- battery life is a bit short after some gaming####[('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
- touch pad seems a little off to me .####[('hardware operation performance', 'negative')]
outside of that , the keyboard is solid , the back lighting was not a selling point to me .####[('keyboard design features', 'positive'), ('keyboard design features', 'neutral')]
track pad is passable .####[('keyboard general', 'neutral')]
i find it to be a little large when used in tablet mode .####[('laptop design features', 'negative')]
so far i absolutely love it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
it greatly exceeded my expectations .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
pro ' s : this chromebook is very light .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
so i went ahead and ordered the c302ca , and after a week of use there are no issues to report .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i ' m loving this thing .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i like it , good construction , can load android apps .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
the main complaints are the touch screen .####[('display general', 'negative')]
asus hit all the right notes on this one .####[('company general', 'positive')]
this little silver bullet is compact , functional , and has held up to everything i ' ve thrown at it .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
the reason for a 4 star rating is due to the provided power cord failing to charge within two months .####[('power supply operation performance', 'negative')]
it feels amazing and the travel is perfect .####[('keyboard portability', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
its really quick at loading web pages .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
i love how much you can customize this and also it is pretty speedy !####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
a great chromebook .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
not having to switch to / from desktop version of websites is great .####[('software design features', 'positive')]
the negatives , the battery will need charging what feels like every 6ish hours depending on use and the speakers are insufficient .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'negative'), ('battery operation performance', 'negative')]
i use this for work , school , and to just watch videos or read books !####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
the keyboard makes it easy to type notes quickly and write papers , and the backlit keyboard is a major plus .####[('keyboard usability', 'positive'), ('keyboard design features', 'positive')]
the look and feel of it are every bit as ` ` sleek ` ` as a mac , which my son and daughters have - - - - - - - but this is about 1 / 4 of the price .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
most of my android apps have worked well ( i have had minor issues with a couple ) .####[('software operation performance', 'positive')]
i think the sound could be better .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'neutral')]
the keyboard is nice to type on .####[('keyboard operation performance', 'positive')]
