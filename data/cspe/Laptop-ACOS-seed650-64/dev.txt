this unit is ` ` pretty ` ` and stylish , so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
some apps don ' t work but the play store is still in beta right now####[('software general', 'neutral'), ('software general', 'negative')]
the screen is very dim however .####[('display operation performance', 'negative')]
keyboard is decent with good travel .####[('keyboard portability', 'positive')]
always loved asus and they build amazing machines .####[('company general', 'positive'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
buy this computer and you ' ll be very happy with it .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
this is the best laptop for the price .####[('laptop price', 'positive')]
i like that it ' s got the 8th generation i5 cpu .####[('cpu general', 'positive')]
it boots in seconds although i usually just leave it on constantly .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
great computer and great value , our second chromebook and first one still doing fine just needed another for family .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
very easy to set up .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
i ' m using it mainly to store movies , and the 1 tb drive is nice .####[('hard disc general', 'positive')]
so , i have had this laptop for almost a week and have put it through the ringer .####[('laptop general', 'neutral')]
if you ' re big on aesthetics then you ' ll love the look .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
it has a full size keyboard , a number pad , a camera , and great big screen !####[('display design features', 'positive'), ('keyboard design features', 'positive'), ('keyboard design features', 'neutral')]
so far i ' m enjoying it .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
many apps aren ' t ` ` compatible ` ` and even the ones that work , they look awful .####[('software operation performance', 'negative')]
i only mention this because , in my opinion , you ' re getting about $ 300 worth of performance here ; anyone telling you this device runs like a $ 500 or $ 800 computer is exaggerating .####[('laptop price', 'negative')]
for home users , these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two - screening , to watching videos and calling family .####[('laptop price', 'positive'), ('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
as a 5 - year chromebook veteran , i ' ve been waiting for this machine .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .####[('cpu operation performance', 'negative'), ('cpu price', 'positive')]
but , honesty , for the intended use case of a budget chromebook ( youtube , bill paying , amazon prime watching machine ) this difference is negligible .####[('laptop quality', 'neutral')]
honestly , i think nobody uses these ports anyway .####[('ports general', 'neutral')]
maybe that ' s a consequence of how the retina display is built , but yeah , it ' s harder to keep the screen clean .####[('display general', 'negative')]
i am extremely happy with this laptop .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
battery life is a huge plus !####[('battery operation performance', 'positive')]
price was very good and met my expectations also shipping was very quick .####[('shipping general', 'positive'), ('laptop price', 'positive')]

configuring the printer was a little tricky but not bad .####[('multimedia devices operation performance', 'neutral')]
my desktop runs all my video editing software for my bigger and most demanding projects and mylaptop is great for editing video and running pc games in places other than my home ( like school ! )####[('laptop miscellaneous', 'positive')]
either they were so slow i couldn ' t get any work done or they just flat out broke after a couple months .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
i have not had any freezing or screen flashing issues .####[('display operation performance', 'positive')]
* extremely weak graphics card .####[('graphics operation performance', 'negative')]
all metal body , very slim form factor , and has a pretty decent touchscreen .####[('display general', 'positive'), ('laptop design features', 'positive')]
the first issue is that the speakers are on either side of the computer , and you can barely hear them on max volume .####[('multimedia devices design features', 'negative')]
don ' t get me wrong , the device flips back and forth very well .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
it ' s their policy to only repair not replace .####[('support quality', 'negative')]
other than this , it ' s a decent product .####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
i would * not * recommend this laptop .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
now , i have been stressed with fixing this laptop since every day has been something new that i need to fix with it .####[('laptop operation performance', 'negative')]
the overall material the laptop is made of feels incredibly cheap .####[('laptop design features', 'negative')]
it is not a very stable build at all .####[('laptop design features', 'negative')]
this is the worst laptop i have ever bought in my entire life .####[('laptop general', 'negative')]
moreover , the 8th gen i5 cpu is amazing .####[('cpu general', 'positive')]
love the form factor and the light weight as i often use my laptop while laying down .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
before the review this package has nice presentation and solid build .####[('laptop design features', 'positive'), ('laptop quality', 'positive')]

having ram problems after 1 .####[('hard disc general', 'negative')]
one of the keys is especially flimsy and feels like it could break at any moment .####[('keyboard quality', 'negative')]
a big part of this device is its gorgeous aesthetic .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
this is a great device and the $ 450 asking price seems fair .####[('laptop price', 'neutral'), ('laptop general', 'positive')]
but it is a bit big and heavy .####[('laptop design features', 'negative')]
it ' s sturdy , and looks and feels great .####[('laptop design features', 'positive')]
love this chromebook !####[('laptop general', 'positive')]
setup was fast and easy , but then again i ' ve been a gmail / gcal / gdocs purist for a while now .####[('laptop usability', 'positive')]
it has exceeded my expectations for performance , functionality and utility .####[('laptop operation performance', 'positive')]
