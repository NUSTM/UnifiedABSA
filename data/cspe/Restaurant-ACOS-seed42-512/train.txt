the service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('service general', 'positive')]
over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .####[('food quality', 'negative'), ('ambience general', 'positive')]

i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('service general', 'positive')]
the manager finally said he would com # # p the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .####[('service general', 'negative')]
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive')]

wish ny had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n ' t include wine ?####[('food prices', 'negative')]
ca n ' t argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .####[('food prices', 'negative')]
what you are paying for is the environment and the name .####[('restaurant prices', 'negative'), ('ambience general', 'neutral'), ('restaurant miscellaneous', 'neutral')]
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .####[('service general', 'negative')]
service was just ok , it is not what you ' d expect for $ 500 .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
terrible waste of money . . scammers####[('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !####[('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table .####[('service general', 'neutral')]
although we were told 10 - 15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .####[('service general', 'negative')]
for each course we waited over 1 / 2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .####[('service general', 'negative')]
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka .####[('service general', 'negative')]
we asked for beverages and never received them .####[('service general', 'negative')]
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !####[('service general', 'negative')]
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !####[('service general', 'negative')]
to top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !####[('restaurant prices', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
i wish i could be refunded !####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
there was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .####[('drinks style options', 'negative')]
the lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .####[('food style options', 'negative')]
everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice !####[('food style options', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
they seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her fork in hand ) .####[('service general', 'negative')]

bukhara is on my top 5 indian places in nyc####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it ' s your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
none was made so i hung up .####[('service general', 'negative')]
it was n ' t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it ' s simply repulsive .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]

i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
terrible would be a compliment !####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
they are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !####[('service general', 'negative'), ('drinks prices', 'negative'), ('food prices', 'negative')]

the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .####[('service general', 'negative')]
polite acknowledgement is out ;####[('service general', 'negative')]
overall the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n ' t sat cooling in front of the guest .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
the place has a nice fit - out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins )####[('service general', 'negative'), ('ambience general', 'positive'), ('drinks style options', 'positive')]
at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you ' re looking to pay by the hour for passive - aggressive torture .####[('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('service general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
how is this palce still open ?####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n ' t say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .####[('service general', 'negative')]
again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !####[('service general', 'negative')]
the level of rudeness was preposterous .####[('service general', 'negative')]

so , if you ' re walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who ' s going to be seating you first . . .####[('service general', 'negative')]

i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , ` ` can i help you ' ' and ` ` how many are in your party . ' '####[('service general', 'negative')]
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .####[('service general', 'negative')]
we did n ' t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
bad staff####[('service general', 'negative')]
