judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
we , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .####[('service general', 'negative')]
they never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .####[('service general', 'negative')]
the food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .####[('food style options', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
after all that , they complained to me about the small tip .####[('service general', 'negative')]
avoid this place !####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
i have eaten at saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the wine list is interesting and has many good values .####[('drinks style options', 'positive'), ('drinks prices', 'positive')]
for the price , you can not eat this well in manhattan .####[('food quality', 'positive'), ('restaurant prices', 'positive')]

the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty ( could ' ve used a bit more salt ) .####[('food style options', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
the decor is night tho . . . but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling . . . its quite un - appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .####[('ambience general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'negative')]

the food is decent .####[('food quality', 'neutral')]
however , it ' s the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .####[('service general', 'negative')]
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self - respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i . e . make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .####[('service general', 'negative')]

the kitchen however , is almost always slow .####[('service general', 'negative')]

once you step into cosette , you ' re miraculously in a small , off - the - beaten path parisian bistro .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain parisian flair .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
the food was average to above - average ; the french onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way .####[('food quality', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'neutral'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
however , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !####[('ambience general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n ' t even fully melted !####[('food quality', 'negative')]
it looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
the pizza is overpriced and soggy .####[('food prices', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n ' t make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .####[('food quality', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
a big disappointment , all around .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]

the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria ' s .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
two complaints - - their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .####[('food style options', 'negative')]

service was very good - prompt , attentive and non - intrusive .####[('service general', 'positive')]
food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt - in - your - mouth experience ) .####[('food quality', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
wine list selection is good and wine - by - the - glass was generously filled to the top .####[('drinks style options', 'positive')]

in any event , this is a place i ' ll be sure to stop by again when i ' m in this part of town .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]

the staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .####[('service general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .####[('service general', 'positive')]
yes , the prices are high , but i felt it was worth it .####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
we all felt it was worth it .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
sometimes i get good food and ok service .####[('service general', 'neutral'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service .####[('food quality', 'positive'), ('service general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
it is not consistent .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
the place is a bistro which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .####[('service general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive'), ('food style options', 'positive')]
and where does patis go wrong ; no where .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but : cassuolet , steake fritte , tripe stew , etc ; simple stuff .####[('food style options', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .####[('ambience general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .####[('food quality', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .####[('drinks quality', 'positive')]
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'neutral')]
overall i would recommend it and go back again .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
i started out with a bombay beer which was big enough for two .####[('drinks style options', 'positive')]
mmmmm . . . it was delicious .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
service was slow , but the people were friendly .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('service general', 'positive')]
it ' s a nice place to relax and have conversation .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
i ca n ' t wait to go back .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the food is authentic italian - delicious !####[('food quality', 'positive')]
pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
ambience is delightful , service impeccable .####[('service general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive')]

i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .####[('service general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
the filet mignon dish was superb !####[('food quality', 'positive')]
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]

we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
we were very disappointed .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
we wo n ' t go to this place again for a good meal .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
however , i think this place is a good hang out spot .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter , so i ' m looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive')]
check this place out !####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
highly recommended ! ! ! ! !####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
first of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by citysearch ' s editorial review .####[('ambience general', 'negative')]
either that , or the editor ' s idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .####[('ambience general', 'negative')]
the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .####[('drinks prices', 'negative'), ('ambience general', 'negative'), ('food style options', 'neutral')]
slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .####[('drinks prices', 'negative'), ('drinks quality', 'negative')]
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .####[('service general', 'negative')]
for instance , plates were just dumped on the table , i was handed the wine list upside down , etc . . . .####[('service general', 'negative')]
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .####[('service general', 'negative')]
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n ' t make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .####[('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
not one of our meals was edible - bland and / or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
fish was overdone .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .####[('service general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive'), ('restaurant general', 'negative')]
someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
one of us actually liked the expresso - that ' s it .####[('drinks quality', 'positive')]

we ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
the decor in this place is very diner - ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .####[('ambience general', 'neutral')]
problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]

the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .####[('service general', 'negative')]
after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from . . . maybe you dont know how things work in america . . . and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .####[('service general', 'negative')]

i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
i would recommend roxy ' s for that , but not for their food .####[('food quality', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !####[('food style options', 'neutral')]
but , they were too big for the bun .####[('food style options', 'negative')]
consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ' nt feel like finishing them .####[('food style options', 'negative')]
also they were $ 15 each !####[('food prices', 'negative')]
i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .####[('food style options', 'neutral')]
it was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami - but it did n ' t have much taste - i ' ve had better for less elsewhere !####[('food prices', 'neutral'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .####[('ambience general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .####[('food quality', 'negative')]

immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .####[('service general', 'negative')]
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary !####[('service general', 'negative')]
for the people who want great food plus great service , roxy is a place to avoid !####[('service general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]

mizu is the japenese find in grammercy .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
while their kitchen food is delicious , their sushi is out of this world .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .####[('food style options', 'positive')]
not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .####[('service general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
warning : you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu !####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired .####[('food style options', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
i expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu .####[('food quality', 'negative'), ('food prices', 'negative')]
the view is spectacular , and the food is great .####[('location general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]

great neighborhood joint .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
this is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the basil slice .####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('food style options', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit - inducing , yuck .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
the counter service is bad .####[('service general', 'negative')]
they charge different prices all the time .####[('service general', 'negative')]
they ' re rude at times , and not very friendly .####[('service general', 'negative')]
no pizza 33 for me !####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
the dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally i ' d drink popcorn topping before i ' d eat another one of these .####[('food style options', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
the sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced .####[('food prices', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
calling the place hampton chutney co . does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('ambience general', 'negative')]
seriously , this place kicks ass .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant .####[('service general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
best italian food i ever had ( and being italian , that means alot ) .####[('food quality', 'positive')]

this is such a lovely , peaceful place to eat outside .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty .####[('location general', 'positive')]

so close , but not good enough .####[('restaurant general', 'neutral')]
do n ' t be fooled by crowds of people .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
the service is awful .####[('service general', 'negative')]
this place is not worth the prices .####[('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]

this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in nyc .####[('service general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
they even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little .####[('food style options', 'positive')]
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee ! !####[('food quality', 'positive'), ('drinks quality', 'positive')]
a little crowded but they move that line really fast !####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative'), ('service general', 'positive')]
a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning !####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !####[('service general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'neutral')]
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !####[('service general', 'negative')]
be sure not to get anything other than bagels ! . .####[('food quality', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
the worst excuse for japanese food i ' ve ever encountered .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
the sushi was awful !####[('food quality', 'negative')]
the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
the fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .####[('food style options', 'negative')]
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
good , fast service .####[('service general', 'positive')]
i would highly recommend .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
food is great and inexpensive .####[('food prices', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]

everything about this restaurant was special .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the service was attentive , yet discreet .####[('service general', 'positive')]

i ' m saving up for my next visit .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the place was quiet and delightful .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
i did not try the caviar but i tried their salmon and crab salad ( they are all good )####[('food quality', 'positive')]
as a retired hipster , i can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year lucky strike has been the best laid - back late night in the city .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she ' s - way - cuter - than - me - that - b @ # $ * way ) .####[('service general', 'positive')]
the food is yummy , especially their cooked - to - perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the bts .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
you can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that ' s about 2 1 / 2 drinks ) for $ 8 . 50 ( i recommend the vanilla shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music .####[('drinks style options', 'positive'), ('drinks prices', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive'), ('drinks quality', 'positive')]
the in - house lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
you ca n ' t go wrong with this place .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
suan is a great place that i often take my friends ( classmates ) too .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to suan again and again .####[('location general', 'positive'), ('restaurant prices', 'positive')]
i love their thai####[('food quality', 'positive')]
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must !####[('food quality', 'positive')]

during the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
i wish they would change back to what it was before .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
the food now is inconsistent .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
this is the kind of place you ' d like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive')]
the setting is casual and romantic .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
prices are very good .####[('restaurant prices', 'positive')]
the food is excellent !####[('food quality', 'positive')]
if you ' re daring , try the balsamic vinegar over icecream , it ' s wonderful !####[('food quality', 'positive')]
they were such a rip - off ( $ 8 . 95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying .####[('food prices', 'negative'), ('food style options', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
the rest of the dim sum , though pricey by chinatown standards , is worth it .####[('food prices', 'positive')]
the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n ' t like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative'), ('service general', 'negative'), ('ambience general', 'negative')]
a few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner :####[('food quality', 'negative'), ('food prices', 'negative')]

the fried dumplings are great !####[('food quality', 'positive')]
finally a reliable chinese restaurant !####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .####[('service general', 'negative')]
the only thing you can do here is walk in and eat . . but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !####[('service general', 'negative')]
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .####[('service general', 'negative')]

the food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it ' s a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , i thought it was just annoying .####[('ambience general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
if celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you ' ll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
rao is a good restaurant , but it ' s nothing special .####[('restaurant general', 'neutral')]

volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n ' t ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .####[('service general', 'positive')]

best indian restaurant in the city####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
what really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices , and all made in - house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .####[('food quality', 'positive')]

it is so romantic .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
its dark , and cozy . . there is always jazz music playing when we go .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like ' that ' couple .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
the food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together .####[('food style options', 'positive')]
i ' ve enjoyed 99 % of the dishes we ' ve ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too - authentic - for - me dish ( i ' m a daring eater but not that daring ) .####[('food quality', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
once you try it for a special occasion beware . . you ca n ' t stop !####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive')]

service was wonderful ;####[('service general', 'positive')]
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .####[('service general', 'positive')]
paul , the maitre d ' , was totally professional and always on top of things .####[('service general', 'positive')]
thank you everyone at water ' s edge .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
would not go back .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
service ok but unfriendly , filthy bathroom .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('ambience general', 'negative')]
the bar drinks were eh , ok to say the least .####[('drinks quality', 'negative')]
the stuff tilapia was horrid . . . tasted like cardboard .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
we thought the dessert would be better , wrong !####[('food quality', 'negative')]
$ 170 down the toilet . . .####[('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting .####[('ambience general', 'negative')]
the floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .####[('ambience general', 'negative')]
good experience####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings .####[('drinks style options', 'positive'), ('service general', 'negative')]
the bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the ` ` free ' ' appetizer of olives was disappointing .####[('food quality', 'neutral'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
however , our main course was wonderful .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
i had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
when we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .####[('service general', 'negative')]
all in all , i would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive')]
short and sweet – seating is great : it ' s romantic , cozy and private .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
the boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they ' re perfect for 2 people .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
the service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('service general', 'positive')]
over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .####[('ambience general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food .####[('food quality', 'negative'), ('ambience general', 'neutral'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try at least once .####[('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('restaurant general', 'positive')]
noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food i enjoy .####[('service general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
servers are all different , greg is my favorite .####[('service general', 'positive')]
sometimes tables do n ' t understand his sense of humor but it ' s refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner .####[('service general', 'positive')]
this is the first place i ' ve been that a runner remembers my order . . . hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant .####[('service general', 'positive')]
prices are fair across the board for both food and bev .####[('drinks prices', 'positive'), ('food prices', 'positive')]
i go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .####[('service general', 'positive')]
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings ! ! !####[('food style options', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]

best dining experience in the west village !####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
stepping into casa la femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in new york !####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night i had !####[('service general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive'), ('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
the have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for !####[('drinks quality', 'positive')]
we were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
i never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
maggot in the food !####[('food quality', 'negative')]
the menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .####[('service general', 'positive'), ('food style options', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'neutral')]
nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that ' s when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('service general', 'positive')]
the manager finally said he would com # # p the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .####[('service general', 'negative')]
we paid and left because we did n ' t feel like arguing any more .####[('service general', 'negative')]
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive'), ('service general', 'negative')]
unhygienic####[('food quality', 'negative')]
i do not recommend .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
i got hair in my food 2 times of then !####[('food quality', 'negative')]
great place , great value .####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('restaurant prices', 'positive')]
the food is flavorful , plentiful and reasonably priced .####[('food prices', 'positive'), ('food style options', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
the atmosphere is relaxed and casual .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]

try it !####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
very pleased####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
good creative rolls !####[('food style options', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi , or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive')]
they have great rolls , the triple color and norwegetan rolls , are awesome and filling .####[('food style options', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
one special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !####[('food style options', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
they have a delicious banana chocolate dessert , as well as a great green tea tempura .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the appetizers are also delicious !####[('food quality', 'positive')]
mazing interior .####[('ambience general', 'negative')]
great food !####[('food quality', 'positive')]
i ' ve had my fair share of modern japanese and this spot delivers .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .####[('ambience general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'negative')]
if you ' re into being lost when you ' re just five feet from your table then hey , that ' s a good thing .####[('ambience general', 'negative')]
despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go - to for modern japanese food for the foreseeable future .####[('ambience general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
indo chinese food , pretty good . . .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
not a very fancy place but very good chinese style indian food .####[('ambience general', 'neutral'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
the chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( i have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the chilli chicken .####[('food quality', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
my mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she ( being indian ) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
still we keep going back : )####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
i was speechless by the horrible food .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
i was so stunned , and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
this place survives on reputation alone .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
i will never return .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
best in all of nyc####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
this is the most wonderful restaurant in all of new york city , not just brooklyn . . .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty , most delicious food and kept it that way . . .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
never swaying , never a bad meal , never bad service . . .####[('service general', 'positive'), ('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
you should travel from the bronx to try it . . .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
great food , great wine list , great service in a great neighborhood . . .####[('drinks style options', 'positive'), ('service general', 'positive'), ('location general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
so delicious ! ! ! ! ! !####[('food quality', 'positive')]
patsy ' s pizza = true love####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
hands down the best pizza on the planet .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
in about 12 minutes , the thing is gone .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
great taste####[('food quality', 'positive')]
great , original taste .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
for me dishes a little oily , but overall dining experience good .####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
helpful service and average price per dish $ 10 .####[('service general', 'positive'), ('food prices', 'neutral')]
great food####[('food quality', 'positive')]
this place has great indian chinese food .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal .####[('food prices', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
be prepared to wait , because the place is pretty tiny .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative'), ('ambience general', 'negative')]
also , they do not take credit card so come with cash !####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'neutral')]
even though the place is not beautiful , the food speaks for itself .####[('ambience general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
best indian chinese in the city , by far !####[('food quality', 'positive')]
amazing my favorite ! ! !####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
i came across village underground by accident , now i go there all the time .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the service is amazing , i ' ve had different waiters and they were all nice , which is a rare thing in nyc .####[('service general', 'positive')]
the dj is awesome , i have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and i keep going back .####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive')]
you can get a table without a reservation if you get there early i they do n ' t make you by bottles .####[('service general', 'positive')]
which lets face it . . . . at times it ' s a good thing .####[('service general', 'positive')]
in the end you end up with a fair tab and nothing but a great time ! ! !####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('restaurant prices', 'positive')]
highly recommended !####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
one of the best , if not the best , restaurants in park slope ( and ny in general )####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
everything on the menu is great .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
this establishment is the real deal .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
wish ny had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n ' t include wine ?####[('food prices', 'negative')]
look , the appetizers were really good .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the entree was also very good .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
ca n ' t argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .####[('food prices', 'negative')]
what you are paying for is the environment and the name .####[('ambience general', 'neutral'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative'), ('restaurant miscellaneous', 'neutral')]
yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .####[('ambience general', 'negative')]
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
vanison was good but not amazing .####[('food quality', 'neutral'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
bison was quite excellent however .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
dessert : pure disaster .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
just not good at all .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all .####[('food style options', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .####[('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say ` ` i ' ve been to the four seasons restaurant ' ' .####[('restaurant prices', 'negative'), ('restaurant miscellaneous', 'neutral')]
all in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) .####[('food quality', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
if you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .####[('service general', 'negative')]
service was just ok , it is not what you ' d expect for $ 500 .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
terrible waste of money . . scammers####[('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience !####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .####[('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .####[('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !####[('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .####[('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table .####[('service general', 'neutral')]
although we were told 10 - 15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .####[('service general', 'negative')]
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the place is beautiful !####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
the hostess was very pleasant .####[('service general', 'positive')]
our experience did not ever get any better .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
for each course we waited over 1 / 2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .####[('service general', 'negative')]
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka .####[('service general', 'negative')]
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .####[('service general', 'negative')]
we asked for beverages and never received them .####[('service general', 'negative')]
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .####[('service general', 'negative')]
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .####[('food prices', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka !####[('service general', 'negative')]
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !####[('service general', 'negative')]
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !####[('service general', 'negative')]
to top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative'), ('service general', 'negative')]
by the time we left our wallets were empty and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !####[('restaurant prices', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .####[('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended . . . and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly !####[('service general', 'negative'), ('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
i wish i could be refunded !####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
do n ' t go with a larger group than 4 !####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
at first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .####[('service general', 'positive')]
the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .####[('food style options', 'neutral')]
there was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .####[('drinks style options', 'negative')]
not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with brahma .####[('drinks style options', 'negative')]
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .####[('service general', 'positive'), ('food style options', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
the lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .####[('food style options', 'negative')]
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the ` ` salt encrusted shrimp ' ' appetizer .####[('food style options', 'negative')]
she replied ` ` well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . ' '####[('service general', 'negative')]
the food arrived in about 15 minutes .####[('service general', 'neutral')]
i had the thai style fried sea bass . . . which was very good .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice !####[('food quality', 'negative'), ('food style options', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
i heard the lobster roll was excellent .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
they seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her fork in hand ) .####[('service general', 'negative')]
all in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh .####[('food prices', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
service not the friendliest to our ` ` large party ' ' !####[('service general', 'negative')]
probably would not go back here .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
great indian food####[('food quality', 'positive')]
food was amazing - i love indian food and eat it quite regularly , but i can say this is one of the best i ' ve had .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
very ` ` normal indian food ' ' , but done really well .####[('food quality', 'positive'), ('food style options', 'neutral')]
also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .####[('service general', 'negative')]
but if you ' re prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for indian food####[('food quality', 'positive'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
one of the best####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
bukhara grill , the tagline says it all . . ` ` indian spice rave ' '####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .####[('food prices', 'positive')]
we have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given .####[('service general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
bukhara is on my top 5 indian places in nyc####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
wretched and retching####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
i have never been so disgusted by both food an service .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
for starters they delivered us someone else ' s order .####[('service general', 'negative')]
however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it ' s your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
none was made so i hung up .####[('service general', 'negative')]
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
it was n ' t as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it ' s simply repulsive .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive')]
i book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .####[('ambience general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
i completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'positive')]
more williamsburg garbage####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart .####[('service general', 'negative')]
the bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n ' t even close to sizzling .####[('food quality', 'neutral'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
too bad i had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl .####[('food prices', 'negative')]
the nakgi - bokum was horrible .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
easily the worst stir - fried squid i ' ve ever tasted .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
the side dishes were passable , and i did get a refill upon request .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service .####[('service general', 'negative')]
she just nodded and walked off .####[('service general', 'negative')]
as to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made .####[('service general', 'negative')]
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
we were charged full price .####[('service general', 'negative')]
lives up to the hype####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
we ' ve tried before but it always packed and does n ' t take reservations .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'neutral')]
it was well worth the wait .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the wife had the risotto which was amazing .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
it does n ' t look appetizing as it ' s covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .####[('food style options', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
a quintessential slice of nyc pizza .####[('food quality', 'neutral')]
the crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
personally i like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie ( that don ’ t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive')]
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate decor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city .####[('ambience general', 'positive'), ('location general', 'neutral')]
if you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
it ’ s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘ excuse me ’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth !####[('service general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive')]
my party had the bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !####[('food style options', 'positive'), ('food prices', 'positive')]
we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the entrees were served with miso soup and rice .####[('food style options', 'neutral')]
for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .####[('food quality', 'neutral'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
i do n ' t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i ' ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive')]
terrible would be a compliment !####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
the service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .####[('service general', 'negative')]
we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing ! !####[('service general', 'negative')]
we never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .####[('service general', 'negative')]
they are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !####[('food prices', 'negative'), ('service general', 'negative'), ('drinks prices', 'negative')]
stay away####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
great shabu shabu####[('food quality', 'positive')]
i love it .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
but for the shabu shabu , you wo n ' t find much better in ny .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .####[('food prices', 'positive'), ('service general', 'positive'), ('food style options', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
dokebi gives williamsburg the right one - two punch of classic korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .####[('food quality', 'positive')]

this place does n ' t make any sense####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
just want to warn you all - do n ' t waste your time and money .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
this place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional . . .####[('ambience general', 'negative')]
this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .####[('ambience general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
the concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n ' t work .####[('food style options', 'negative')]
good food####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , i do n ' t like being cramp in a corner .####[('ambience general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
over all it was a very nice romantic place .####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive')]
loved it####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the atmosphere was great .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
the food we ordered was excellent , although i would n ' t say the margaritas were anything to write home about .####[('drinks quality', 'neutral'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
our waitress was n ' t mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .####[('service general', 'neutral')]
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
regardless , we ' ll be back and ca n ' t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'positive')]
dumbfoundingly poor####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
this was , from start to finish , a mind - bogglingly uncomfortable experience .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn .####[('service general', 'negative')]
the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .####[('service general', 'negative')]
polite acknowledgement is out ;####[('service general', 'negative')]
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?####[('service general', 'negative')]
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
overall the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n ' t sat cooling in front of the guest .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
the place has a nice fit - out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins )####[('drinks style options', 'positive'), ('service general', 'negative'), ('ambience general', 'positive')]
at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you ' re looking to pay by the hour for passive - aggressive torture .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('restaurant general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
on that scale , it ' s a world - beater .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
how is this palce still open ?####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
i honestly do n ' t even know where to begin .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
we arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .####[('service general', 'positive')]
everything was going good until we got our meals .####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .####[('food style options', 'negative')]
it was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .####[('food style options', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms .####[('food quality', 'negative'), ('food prices', 'negative')]
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n ' t say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .####[('service general', 'negative')]
so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
i could n ' t even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .####[('food style options', 'negative')]
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , ` ` oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier ' ' no apology , nothing .####[('service general', 'negative')]
after that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !####[('service general', 'negative')]
no desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !####[('service general', 'negative')]
this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it ' s a matter of taste that she did n ' t like it , and i can not comp it .####[('service general', 'negative')]
again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !####[('service general', 'negative')]
the level of rudeness was preposterous .####[('service general', 'negative')]
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive'), ('drinks quality', 'positive')]
i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
this staff should be fired .####[('service general', 'negative')]
cirspy crust margherita pizza####[('food quality', 'positive')]
it was really good pizza .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded : ) : ) : )####[('food style options', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
i ' ll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .####[('ambience general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this place .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
well . . . they can run but they ca n ' t hide .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
this place . . . god where do i begin .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
the decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n ' t notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 frickin hours to come ! ! ! !####[('food prices', 'negative'), ('service general', 'negative'), ('ambience general', 'neutral'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
great hot dogs !####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the hot dogs are top notch , and they ' re slamwich is amazing !####[('food quality', 'positive')]
going to bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !####[('restaurant general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
only complaint is the pricing - - i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .####[('food prices', 'negative')]
fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n ' t put you off –####[('service general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
it ' s a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we ' ve eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .####[('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
each time we ' ve been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they ' re fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('service general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
as bfc does n ' t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative'), ('service general', 'negative')]
the frizzy retro girl ( with winged / dame edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .####[('service general', 'negative')]
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she ` ` had a bbq to go to ' ' that night - wtf ? ?####[('service general', 'negative')]
i ' d be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !####[('service general', 'negative')]
there ' s another girl who i ca n ' t describe , she is about 5 ' 6 ' ' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you ' re * really * talking about .####[('service general', 'negative')]
i ' m a friendly person , so i would n ' t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .####[('service general', 'negative')]
again , i ' d be super upset if that were my employee .####[('service general', 'negative')]
considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
so , if you ' re walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who ' s going to be seating you first . . .####[('service general', 'negative')]
maitre - d - ' ' eat and get out ' '####[('service general', 'negative')]
while finishing our meals which included a high - end bottle of wine , our son ' s fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .####[('drinks quality', 'positive')]
this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .####[('service general', 'negative')]
his response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .####[('service general', 'negative')]
if you go here , do it on his off - night .####[('service general', 'negative')]
best meal in a long time !####[('food quality', 'positive')]
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
my father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish .####[('food quality', 'positive')]
the four seasons restaurant is a great experience .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the food is great and the environment is even better .####[('ambience general', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
everyone must come here at least once .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
highly recommend it !####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
taking hot dogs to the next level####[('food quality', 'positive')]
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at bark you do n ' t just get your average hot dog .####[('restaurant prices', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .####[('food style options', 'positive'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
great atmosphere####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
i highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .####[('food quality', 'neutral'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .####[('ambience general', 'positive'), ('ambience general', 'negative')]
poor service and management####[('service general', 'negative')]
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
appetizers took nearly an hour .####[('service general', 'negative')]
never got an explanation as to what was going on .####[('service general', 'negative')]
the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .####[('service general', 'negative')]
on the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .####[('service general', 'negative')]
can ’ t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
what a hassle !####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
the food is very good , but not outstanding .####[('food quality', 'neutral'), ('food quality', 'positive')]
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('food quality', 'negative')]
on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .####[('service general', 'negative')]
mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine . . . but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff .####[('service general', 'negative')]
expensive####[('restaurant prices', 'negative')]
the pasta was well cooked , did n ' t have enough sauce though or flavor .####[('food quality', 'negative')]
so rude ! ! !####[('service general', 'negative')]
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .####[('restaurant general', 'negative')]
the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .####[('service general', 'negative')]
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .####[('service general', 'negative')]
i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane .####[('service general', 'negative')]
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , ` ` can i help you ' ' and ` ` how many are in your party . ' '####[('service general', 'negative')]
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .####[('service general', 'negative')]
we did n ' t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem .####[('restaurant miscellaneous', 'negative')]
bad staff####[('service general', 'negative')]
i generally like this place .####[('restaurant general', 'positive')]
the design of the space is good .####[('ambience general', 'positive')]
but the service is horrid !####[('service general', 'negative')]
i was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .####[('service general', 'negative')]
the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .####[('service general', 'negative')]
i ca n ' t believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !####[('service general', 'negative')]
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .####[('service general', 'negative')]
i could n ' t ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .####[('service general', 'negative')]
she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .####[('service general', 'negative')]
i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would retrain the staff .####[('service general', 'negative'), ('restaurant general', 'negative')]
